They banned any parental feedback and deferred to the activist themselves to review it and approve it, despite the fact that it heavily promotes gender diasphora, and the fantasies of Ben Levin.\n\nThese totalitarians operate under the guise of gaining equality for a supposed marginalized group, but are willing to go scorched earth with your children to get what they want.
