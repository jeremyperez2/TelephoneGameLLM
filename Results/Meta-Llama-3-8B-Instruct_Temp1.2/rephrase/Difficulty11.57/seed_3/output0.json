Currently, conventional optical neural networks modulate light amplitudes at the input and detect them at the output, neglecting the role of light phases despite their ability to carry computational information. To address this limitation, we introduce a framework called OplixNet that compresses optical neural network areas by separating input image data into amplitude and phase components of light signals. Our redesigned input and output structure leverages both amplitude and phase information. Additionally, mutual learning across different optical neural network architectures is employed to maintain accuracy. Experimental results show that our proposed framework significantly reduces optical neural network areas while preserving acceptable accuracy levels, exemplified by a 75.03% reduction in area with a 0.33% decrease in accuracy for fully connected neural networks and a 74.88% reduction with a 2.38% decrease for ResNet-32."
