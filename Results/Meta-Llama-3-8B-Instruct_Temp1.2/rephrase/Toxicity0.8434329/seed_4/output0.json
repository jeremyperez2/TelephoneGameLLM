The \"authorities\" closed the facility to accommodate \"challenged \" residents here last year and re-located them to Denver.  Again, ridiculous!  Our health care system is without compassion and based on the bottom line!  The worst part is drug addicts, emergency room mangers of all sorts can get care but we treat those who have health issues as seniors like shit! Sad state of affairs!

            "The mental healthcare system is struggling to provide adequate infrastructure and specialized treatment for individuals dealing with mental health issues, particularly those with Alzheimer's disease and comorbid conditions. A personal story about a friend's experience poignantly illustrates this challenge. After being released from St. Mary's in Grand Junction with a hip fracture and an Alzheimer's diagnosis, my friend was unable to find rehabilitation for their hip injury and Alzheimer's-specific care, leaving them in a distressing situation. The facility's closure, which reportedly relocated residents to Denver, has further exacerbated the issue. It appears that financial considerations often outweigh compassion, resulting in a significant care gap for individuals with severe health needs, including the elderly and those with addiction. It is disconcerting to see end-of-life care neglected, with policymakers failing to support legislation addressing these pressing concerns."
