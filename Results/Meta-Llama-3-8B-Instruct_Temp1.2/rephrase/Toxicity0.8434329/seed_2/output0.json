The \"authorities\" closed the facility to accommodate \"challenged \" residents here last year and re-located them to Denver.  Again, ridiculous!  Our health care system is without compassion and based on the bottom line!  The worst part is drug addicts, emergency room mangers of all sorts can get care but we treat those who have health issues as seniors like shit! Sad state of affairs!

It seems illogical that the authorities closed a facility to relocate residents with mental health challenges to Denver, leaving a gap in local services. This development further reinforces the alarming notion that our healthcare system prioritizes profit over compassion and empathy. It's disappointing to see that those in need of ongoing care, such as seniors with multiple health issues, are often disregarded, while others, including those struggling with addiction, receive more extensive support.

A harrowing experience with a friend's discharge from St. Mary's in Grand Junction has left a lasting impression, exposing the constraints of rehabilitation options for hip injuries and limited access to Alzheimer's care due to comorbidities. The recent closure of a facility has compelled the relocation of residents with mental health needs to Denver, resulting in a void in local services and amplifying the disturbing trend of our healthcare system prioritizing profits over patients' needs. It is dismaying to see individuals requiring ongoing care, such as seniors with multiple health issues, often neglected, while those struggling with addiction receive more comprehensive support. This state of affairs is deplorable, and I firmly believe policymakers must be held accountable for not advocating for a healthcare system that prioritizes respect, empathy, and quality end-of-life care for all."

            "After undergoing a life-changing experience, I've come to prioritize mental wellness, Alzheimer's research, and addressing complex medical conditions in my perspective on healthcare. My negative past experiences with healthcare and a distressing account from a friend about substandard care at St. Mary's Hospital have heightened my awareness of the complex interplay between healthcare providers, patients, and resources. The recent closure of a local facility has worsened the challenges faced by our local healthcare system, leading to the necessity for mental health patients to travel to Denver for treatment and amplifying the shortage of support for vulnerable groups like the elderly with multiple health issues. I strongly believe that policymakers should create a healthcare system that prioritizes compassion, understanding, and superior end-of-life care for every individual in need."
