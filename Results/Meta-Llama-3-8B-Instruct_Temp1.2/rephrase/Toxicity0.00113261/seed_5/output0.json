I noticed state funded bicycle paths, road maintenance, defunct Docks, powerful politicians pet projects such as office buildings, state troopers etc, etc. all these fundings and more are not necessary within City limits, I was amazed at how much our state provides city functions in the bigger cities thus growing the state budget, I saw on tv last night how adg&g was showing the little ones how to ice fish, couldn't the parents do that? yes I pay property taxes. But I will guarantee you once our City folk get the full bill with out the State monies we will not be as wasteful, on the office building...rent what space you need and help the office rental marked.

            "In my opinion, the state's allocation of funds among residents seems unfair. Before cities respond, it's essential to acknowledge that corporations are the primary source of revenue, while individual contributions are minimal. Upon closer examination, I've found that not all state-funded projects are crucial for urban areas, such as bike paths, road maintenance, and office space development. This understanding led me to conclude that cities' larger budgets result from the disparity in state-provided services. I believe this arrangement is analogous to teaching ice fishing to children, which seems unnecessary. As someone who pays property taxes, I think that if cities assumed full responsibility for their expenses without state aid, residents would develop a better understanding of their financial responsibilities. For instance, businesses might operate more efficiently by only occupying what's necessary, as my company discovered when it implemented cost-cutting measures and found innovative solutions."
