Presently no one except Corporations pay State income taxes. No individual pays state taxes. I noticed state funded bicycle paths, road maintenance, defunct Docks, powerful politicians pet projects such as office buildings, state troopers etc, etc. all these fundings and more are not necessary within City limits, I was amazed at how much our state provides city functions in the bigger cities thus growing the state budget, I saw on tv last night how adg&g was showing the little ones how to ice fish, couldn't the parents do that? yes I pay property taxes. But I will guarantee you once our City folk get the full bill with out the State monies we will not be as wasteful, on the office building...rent what space you need and help the office rental marked.

The state provides a significant portion of city services in larger cities, which contributes to an inflated state budget. For example, I saw a TV show recently teaching children how to ice fish, but couldn't parents take on this responsibility instead?

It's striking that businesses are the sole contributors to state income taxes, while individuals are exempt from this responsibility. Upon closer inspection of state-funded initiatives, such as bike lanes and road maintenance, it's evident that urban residents disproportionately benefit from funding, with larger cities receiving a disproportionate allocation.
