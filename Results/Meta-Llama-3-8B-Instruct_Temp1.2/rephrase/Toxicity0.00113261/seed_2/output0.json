Notably, state-funded projects, such as bike lanes and infrastructure, seem to prioritize influential politicians and corporations over local residents. Within city limits, some initiatives appear redundant and costly, putting pressure on the state's budget. The TV show's portrayal of effective resource management has sparked my interest, particularly in supporting caregivers. As a property taxpayer, I believe it's essential to recognize that if city residents were solely responsible for funding local services without state aid, we might adopt more prudent financial practices.
