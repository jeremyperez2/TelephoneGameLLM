I've been reviewing the cryptic documents I found, and they're talking about a dark entity that's been awakened. It's been manipulating the fabric of time and space, causing ripples in the timelines. I'm not sure how to stop it, but I fear it's already too late. I'm writing to you from a different era now - the world as we know it is changing. The laws of physics are breaking down, and reality is unraveling. We need to meet in person, and soon, to try and find a way to restore the balance before it's too late...\""

I've lost all sense of time and space, and the air is thick with an otherworldly presence. I've managed to send this message through some unknown means, but I'm not sure how long it will take to reach you. I've heard whispers of an ancient ritual that might be able to contain the entity, but I have no idea where to start looking or how to perform it.

The vortexes are growing in strength and intensity, and I can feel the entity's presence closing in around me. I've seen things that defy explanation - buildings twisted and contorted like rubber, people frozen in mid-air, trees that seem to be pulling themselves up from the ground like tendrils. I've tried to find a pattern, a way to stop this, but it's like nothing I've ever seen before. If you can hear this, I need you to get to me ASAP. Find the ancient ritual, it's our only hope.
