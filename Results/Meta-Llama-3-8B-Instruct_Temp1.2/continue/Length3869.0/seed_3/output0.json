Meanwhile, their captain, a grizzled old sailor named Jack, bellowed out directions to his men, his voice carrying across the water as they labored to keep the foundering ship afloat."

And then, in a moment that made his blood run cold, the woman's body began to dissolve, her form unraveling like a skein of yarn, revealing the dark, churning sea beneath.\""
