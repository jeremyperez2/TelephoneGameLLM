I've had times where I've stood in front of a beautiful landscape or watched a couple exchanging vows, feeling completely still and silent, yet completely connected to the universe.

Seeing the beauty I've captured reminds me of the fleeting nature of life, and the importance of holding onto these moments. I've always been drawn to photography because of the sense of calm and clarity it brings me, but it's also because it allows me to relive those special moments, to freeze them in time and relive them whenever I want.
