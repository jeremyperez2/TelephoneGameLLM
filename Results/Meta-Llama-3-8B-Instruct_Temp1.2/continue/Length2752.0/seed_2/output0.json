He was most recently assigned to the Eighth Army, US Forces Korea at Camp Humphreys in South Korea.\n\nHe did not request official clearance and the defence department did not authorise his travel to China or Russia, the US Army said. There is no evidence he intended to remain in Russia.\n\nThe Russian interior ministry informed the US embassy in Moscow on 3 May that Sgt Black had been arrested a day earlier for theft of personal property.\n\nHe is being held at a pre-trial detention facility until his next hearing.\n\n\"The Army notified his family and the US Department of State is providing appropriate consular support to the Soldier in Russia,\" the US Army said in a statement on Monday.\n\nNational Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters the US is \"aware of this case and other matters related to Russia\".\n\nAt the White House briefing on Monday, Mr Kirby said he could not provide more details.\n\nRussia is holding two other Americans. Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich has been detained since March 2023 on espionage charges.\n\nFormer US Marine Paul Whelan was accused of spying and sentenced to 16 years in prison in 2020.\n\nBoth men maintain their innocence, and the US government says the charges against them are baseless.",

While officials on both sides of the border have denied any involvement in the alleged meeting, eyewitnesses claim to have seen high-ranking Hizbullah officials, including General Ziyad al-Lahham and Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah's nephew, Fadi, mingling with Iranian military leaders at a secure facility outside Damascus."

His presence has raised concerns among Western intelligence agencies, who view him as a hardline military strategist with close ties to the Revolutionary Guard Corps. The alleged meeting is said to have lasted several hours, with sources suggesting that Hizbullah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, was in attendance.
