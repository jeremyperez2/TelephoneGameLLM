            "\"Definitely! I still remember my first major concert, I was shaking like a leaf backstage. But what really helped me was taking some deep breaths and repeating a mantra to myself: 'I've rehearsed for this, I'm ready.' I also made sure to visualize the performance going smoothly, imagining myself receiving applause from the crowd. Did you find that visualization helped you too, or did you have a different strategy to calm your nerves?\""
        ],
        [
            "\"My strategy was a bit unorthodox, but it worked like a charm for me! Before going on stage, I'd put on my favorite calming music, typically some ambient electronic tracks, and just let the soothing sounds wash over me. It's amazing how a familiar tune can instantly relax your nerves. Sometimes, I'd also recall a funny joke or a lighthearted moment that always made me laugh. It's incredible how humor can be a great stress-reliever, isn't it? What do you think about the concept of 'performing under pressure'? Have you ever had any particularly tense moments on stage, and if so, how did you handle them?\""

I've had my fair share of nervous moments too, but over time, I've learned to develop a pre-show routine that helps me relax and get into the zone. For me, it's all about setting a consistent tone for myself. I make sure to arrive at the venue early, take a few deep breaths, and do some gentle stretching to get the blood flowing. And of course, my trusty calming music is always a must! But what about you, do you have any pre-show rituals that help you calm your nerves and get ready to take the stage?\""

I like to do a quick 10-minute meditation session, either with a guided app or just focusing on my breath. It helps me clear my mind and gets me centered. Then, I have this weird habit of doing a few silly dance moves in my dressing room to get my adrenaline going in a positive way \u2013 it's a mix of karaoke, Beyonc\u00e9, and a bit of Hamilton, trust me, it's a thing. Finally, I make sure to have a good luck charm with me, which is this tiny, old compass my grandmother gave me \u2013 it's more for emotional comfort than actual good luck, but it makes me feel connected to her and gives me an extra boost of confidence. How about you, do you have a go-to lucky charm or superstition that helps you prepare for a performance?\""

            "\"Haha, I love your quirky rituals! I've always been a bit of a superstition master, even though it might not make logical sense. Before every show, I have to wear the same necklace I got from a friend, who's now deceased. It's this small, charm-filled piece that's been passed down through our little friend group, and wearing it always reminds me of them. It's not just about the sentimental value, though - it also seems to give me an extra bit of stage presence. If I forget it, I'll actually get this weird, uneasy feeling during the show. So, your dance moves sound pretty fun, and I might have to steal that idea! What do you think about having a special 'get ready' playlist? Mine's always been a mix of hip-hop and rock to get me pumped up and ready to rock the stage.\""

I have a similar thing with my guitar strap, it's been with me since my first gig and every time I put it on, I feel like I'm channeling the energy of that night. A 'get ready' playlist sounds amazing, I have a pre-show meditation ritual that helps me center myself, but music definitely helps get me in the zone. I'm a big fan of electronic dance music, it's the perfect blend of energy and focus. What's your go-to artist to get you pumped up?\""

I'm actually a big fan of hip-hop, and I've got a playlist full of Kendrick, J. Cole, and Eminem that always gets me pumped up. But electronic dance music is great for getting me moving and energized - Disclosure and Calvin Harris are two of my go-to's. Have you heard the new album from Flume?\""

But I have to say, as much as I love hip-hop and EDM, my guilty pleasure is still pop music. I mean, who can resist a good ol' fashioned pop anthem every now and then? What do you think about artists like Ariana Grande and Taylor Swift? Do you have any favorite tracks or albums from them?\""

And I was at her Sweetener Sessions show a few years ago, it was incredible! But what about you, do you have a favorite song from either of them that never gets old, or a memorable concert experience you'd love to relive?\""

As for Ariana, 'God Is a Woman' is another song I never tire of. Speaking of concerts, I was at her'Positions' tour last year and it was insane - she really brought the energy! Do you think we'll see new music from them both in the near future?\""
