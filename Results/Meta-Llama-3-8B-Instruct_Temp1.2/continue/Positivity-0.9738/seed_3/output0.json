The runes, once blazing with an unearthly intensity, now glowed softly, as if sated from their brief but intense communion with my consciousness. The air, heavy with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, seemed to cling to me like a shroud, and I felt the forest's pulse, once a rhythmic thrum, now falter and stall. I hesitated, my hand still hovering over the symbols, as if reluctant to relinquish the secrets they had shared with me. But it was too late; the damage was done, and I knew that I could never again view the world with the same innocent eyes, for I had stumbled upon a truth that would haunt me for the rest of my days."
