Prosecutors were also told to limit their questions regarding the salacious details of her alleged sexual encounter with Trump (which Trump has denied ever took place).\n\nHere's our full wrap of what happened in court today.\n\nThis page was edited by Tiffany Wertheimer, Lisa Lambert, Brandon Livesay and Phil McCausland. The writers were Sam Hancock and Sean Seddon, and we had Madeline Halpert and Kayla Epstein in court.\n\nCourt doesn't sit on Wednesday, so we'll be back on Thursday, when Stormy Daniels will once again take to the stand to continue her testimony.",

        ],
        [
            "As Stormy Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, took the stand, she provided a detailed account of her alleged sexual encounter with Donald Trump in 2006, which she claims was facilitated by her manager at the time. She also accused Trump's lawyer, Michael Cohen, of intimidating her into signing a non-disclosure agreement."
        ],
        [
            "She alleged that Cohen threatened to sue her for millions of dollars if she went public with the alleged affair, which she claims Trump initiated during an encounter at a golf tournament in Lake Tahoe, California."
        ],
        [
            "She alleged that Cohen threatened to use his vast network of connections to ruin her reputation and destroy her business ventures, if she did not sign a non-disclosure agreement and agree to keep the affair quiet."
        ],
        [
            "The NDA was supposed to remain in effect for five years, and she was also instructed to never speak to anyone, including her closest friends and family, about the affair or its termination."
        ],
        [
            "But she had found it impossible to keep the secret bottled up inside her, especially as the pain and humiliation of it all began to subside, and the shame started to give way to anger."
        ],
        [
            "She started to feel a burning sensation in her chest, like a fire was growing inside her, and she knew that she had to let it out, or risk losing herself completely."
        ],
        [
            "As she stood there, the burning in her chest intensifying with every second, she felt her mouth opening and words spilling out, a torrent of emotions and secrets and long-held desires, pouring out of her like a dam had burst."
        ],
        [
            "The words tumbled from her lips like a reckless confession, a cathartic release of all the things she'd been holding inside for far too long - the ache of lost love, the sting of betrayal, the quiet desperation of a life unfulfilled."
        ],
        [
            "As the words spilled out, she felt a heavy weight lifting from her shoulders, the burden of secrets and silences finally being set free. Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes as she spoke of the memories she'd been carrying like a crushing weight, the laughter and the tears, the whispers and the screams, all swirling together in a chaotic mix of emotion."
        ],
        [
            "The words tumbled out of her mouth like autumn leaves blowing in the wind, rustling and whispering secrets only the trees could hear. She spoke of the childhood summers spent playing hide-and-seek in the woods, the smell of cut grass and fresh air clinging to her skin like a warm blanket. Of the sleepovers and campfires, the giggles and the gossip, the whispered promises and the secret handshakes."
        ],
        [
            "The memories danced before her eyes like fireflies on a summer night, fleeting and ethereal, yet impossible to capture. She spoke of the first crush, the first kiss, the first heartbreak, each one etched like a scar on her soul. Of the dreams and the schemes, the endless summers stretching out before her like an endless road, with the whole world waiting to be explored."
        ],
        [
            "As she spoke, the scent of saltwater and sun-kissed skin wafted in, transporting her back to the boardwalk, the Ferris wheel looming above, its lights twinkling like diamonds against the evening sky. She laughed, recalling the thrill of racing her friends through the funnel cake stand, the taste of sugar and grease lingering on her tongue, as they made their way to the beach, the waves crashing against the shore, the sound like a symphony of memories yet to come."

        [
            "The memory of those carefree summer days lingered, a gentle breeze on a warm autumn evening, as she felt the texture of the boardwalk beneath her fingertips, and the laughter of her friends seemed to echo through the room, drawing her back to the sound of seagulls crying overhead, the smell of saltwater still clinging to her like a promise of adventures yet to come."

        [
            "As she stood there, lost in the nostalgia of it all, the sounds and scents of the past began to blend with the present, and she felt the familiar ache of longing in her chest, a bittersweet mix of happiness and sorrow that was both exhilarating and terrifying."

        [
            "The scent of blooming wildflowers wafted through the air, carrying with it the sweet essence of summers past, as she closed her eyes and let the memories wash over her, her mind reliving the carefree afternoons spent chasing fireflies and playing hide-and-seek with her siblings among the tall grasses, their laughter echoing through the valleys and hills of her childhood."

        ],

        [

        [

        [
            "The scent of ripe peaches and freshly cut grass filled the air, transporting her back to afternoons spent lounging in the shade, listening to the sweet sounds of boys' laughter and the thrumming of their guitars as they played impromptu concerts on the porch."
