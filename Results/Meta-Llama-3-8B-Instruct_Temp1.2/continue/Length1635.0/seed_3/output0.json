The writers were Sam Hancock and Sean Seddon, and we had Madeline Halpert and Kayla Epstein in court.\n\nCourt doesn't sit on Wednesday, so we'll be back on Thursday, when Stormy Daniels will once again take to the stand to continue her testimony.",

The proposed bill, which has been in the works for months, aims to strengthen conflict of interest provisions and mandate greater disclosure around presidential meetings and communications with foreign governments, insiders say."

Critics, however, are warning that such a move could lead to a constitutional crisis and overstep the President's authority."

I forced myself to take a few slow, deep breaths, trying to calm my racing mind. But as I lay there, I couldn't shake the feeling that the darkness was still with me, watching me, waiting for its chance to strike again."
