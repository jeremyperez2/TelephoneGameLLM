Croatia, on the other hand, is all about the history and architecture - I've seen pictures of the ancient cities and would love to wander through the streets and explore the old towns. As for what kind of vacation I'm looking for, I think I'm leaning towards a mix of relaxation and adventure. Maybe a few days of beach time to recharge, followed by some hiking or biking in the mountains. Do either of those destinations sound like they would offer that kind of balance?"

Plus, Costa Rica has such a great laid-back vibe, I'm sure you'd find plenty of relaxation opportunities amidst all the adventure."
