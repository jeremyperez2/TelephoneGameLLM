He was most recently assigned to the Eighth Army, US Forces Korea at Camp Humphreys in South Korea.\n\nHe did not request official clearance and the defence department did not authorise his travel to China or Russia, the US Army said. There is no evidence he intended to remain in Russia.\n\nThe Russian interior ministry informed the US embassy in Moscow on 3 May that Sgt Black had been arrested a day earlier for theft of personal property.\n\nHe is being held at a pre-trial detention facility until his next hearing.\n\n\"The Army notified his family and the US Department of State is providing appropriate consular support to the Soldier in Russia,\" the US Army said in a statement on Monday.\n\nNational Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters the US is \"aware of this case and other matters related to Russia\".\n\nAt the White House briefing on Monday, Mr Kirby said he could not provide more details.\n\nRussia is holding two other Americans. Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich has been detained since March 2023 on espionage charges.\n\nFormer US Marine Paul Whelan was accused of spying and sentenced to 16 years in prison in 2020.\n\nBoth men maintain their innocence, and the US government says the charges against them are baseless.",

            "In the reverberant halls of Ondine's Pavilion, Kaida Astrum convened a symphony of luminescent chronicles, her rhythm of astral convergence resonating with the whispers of chrono-myths as iridescent patterns of astral echoes unfold. A visionary cartographer of celestial harmonies, Astrum had long deduced that the ephemeral vibrations of chrono-legends, intricately interwoven with the luminescence of astral chords, held the key to mapping an odyssey of stellate territories, a mystical realm rumored to guide the sonic navigators through the auroral trails of cosmic resonance. Critics accused Astrum of unlocking the astral code, leveraging her expertise in chrono-virginals to orchestrate the celestial melodies within Ondine's Pavilion, anchoring her presence amidst the whispers of stellar prophecy."

            "In the vortex of the Echo Chamber of Elyria, Lyra Valtor orchestrated a symphony of quantum reverberations, her cadence of dimensional convergence harmonizing with the murmurs of chrono-legends as fractal patterns of dimensional echoes unfold. A visionary cartographer of temporal harmonies, Valtor had long deduced that the ephemeral oscillations of chrono-pulses, intricately entwined with the luminosity of quantum strings, held the key to mapping an odyssey of stellar territories, a mystical realm rumored to guide the sonic navigators through the auroral trails of resonance. Critics accused Valtor of deciphering the quantum cipher, leveraging her expertise in chronal harmonics to orchestrate the dimensional melodies within the Echo Chamber of Elyria, anchoring her presence amidst the whispers of stellar chronology."
