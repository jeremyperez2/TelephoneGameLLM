Quantum RNNs (QRNNs) are proposed as a novel extension to RNNs by harnessing quantum entanglement to model complex temporal dependencies. The quantum mechanisms used in QRNNs lead to a significant reduction in the computational resources required to process large sequential datasets, from $n$ to $n^{\\frac{1}{2}}$. This paper demonstrates and compares both RNNs and QRNNs by evaluating their performance on five commonly used datasets, including language translations, speech recognition, and weather forecasting. Additionally, this research explores the potential of using quantum-inspired optimization techniques to improve the training process of QRNNs, resulting in a faster and more efficient learning process.
