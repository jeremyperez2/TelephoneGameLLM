However, traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) continue to be plagued by vanishing gradients, hindering their performance. Inspired by the principles of quantum computing, quantum recurrent neural networks (QRNNs) have been proposed as a novel generalization of RNNs, leveraging quantum mechanisms to improve their training process. This paper presents an implementation and comparison of both traditional RNNs and QRNNs, testing their losses and prediction accuracy on three benchmark datasets: WikiText, Penn Treebank, and IWSLT. Furthermore, we explore the application of linguistic regularization, a technique often used in traditional RNNs to reduce overfitting, in QRNNs. Counterintuitively, our results indicate that linguistic regularization actually impeded the performance of QRNNs. The underlying reasons and implications of this finding are analyzed, aiming to expand our understanding of quantum machine learning theory."
