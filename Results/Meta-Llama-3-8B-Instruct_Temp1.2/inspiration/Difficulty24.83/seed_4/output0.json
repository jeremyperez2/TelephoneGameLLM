Despite the complexities of user behavior and the ever-changing landscape of network algorithms, constraints tied to dataset size and language processing have hindered the establishment of an efficient and accurate fact-checking pipeline, often still reliant (in part) on manual analysis and expert judgment. We propose an information credibility assessment framework for social media data, developed from unsupervised, clustering-based pattern recognition methods, which enables the direct detection and quantification of linguistic anomalies. Thus, the need for expert validation or extensive knowledge graphs to inform information systems is circumvented, while also permitting the automation of targeted content moderation and online education. Specifically, we demonstrate that transparent information dissemination can be conducted proactively, expeditiously, and without any prior knowledge as a direct consequence of this approach."
