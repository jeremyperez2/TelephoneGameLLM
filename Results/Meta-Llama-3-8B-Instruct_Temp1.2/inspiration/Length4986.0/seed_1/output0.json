    "initial_story": "We perhaps should not be surprised that the prime minister has seized upon an extrapolation of Thursday's local election results that pointed to the prospect that the general election could result in a hung parliament in which Labour would be the largest party.\n\nSuch a scenario, he argued, would mean that Sir Keir Starmer would be \"propped up in Downing Street\" by the SNP, the Liberal Democrats, and the Greens.\n\nMany Conservative MPs (and indeed Labour ones too) believe that a poster their party ran in the 2015 election, when the polls were pointing to a hung parliament, showing the then Labour leader, Ed Miliband, in the pocket of the former SNP leader, Alex Salmond, played a key role in delivering the Conservatives a surprise overall majority.\n\nWhether or not that is what happened is not easy for analysts to say. However, British Election Study data collected at the time did not show any marked swing away from Labour among those who came to believe that Mr Miliband would be willing to do a deal with the SNP.\n\nBut, in any event, how realistic is it to use the share of the vote won by the parties in local elections to anticipate what might happen in an immediate general election? There are certainly two potential difficulties.\n\nAlthough the ups and downs in party performance in local elections often run in parallel with the rises and falls in party support in the polls, some people (around one in five) vote differently in local elections than they would in a general election.\n\nAs a result the divergence between the level of support parties win in a local election and how well they would perform in a general election has become more marked.\n\nNowadays the Liberal Democrats consistently outperform their national standing in the local ballot boxes. The same has also come to be true of the Greens, while independent candidates have also enjoyed some notable success in recent years. Labour, in contrast, often do less well in local elections.\n\nMeanwhile, the party political battle in Scotland is now very different from that in England - and the outcome of the current battle north of the border between Labour and the SNP could be crucial to the result of the next election. English local elections do not tell us much about what will happen north of the border.\n\nThese developments have made discerning the implications of local elections for the outcome of a general election more difficult.\n\nAt the same time, there are two particular features of the results of this year's local elections that make it especially difficult.\n\nFirst, the polls suggest that more people who voted Conservative in 2019 have now switched to Reform than to Labour. But Reform were only on the ballot paper in one in six council wards. So, it may well be the case that people who would vote Reform if there had been a Reform candidate locally stuck with the Tories instead.\n\nCertainly, Conservative support fell more heavily where Reform did stand. In the BBC's sample of key wards the party's support fell by 19 points in these wards - compared with 11 points in wards where Reform did not stand. Labour, in contrast, did rather better where Reform stood.\n\nThat 19-point drop matches the 19-point fall in the average level of Conservative support in the polls since May 2021. That figure may represent a better guide to the Conservatives' immediate prospects in a general election.\n\nSecond, the local election results confirm the message from last year's contests that the geography of party support has changed to the Conservatives' disadvantage.\n\nThe party's support fell more heavily in wards it was trying to defend.\n\nAt the same time, some voters seemingly voted for whichever party was best placed to defeat the Conservatives locally. Labour's support increased most (at the expense of the Liberal Democrats) in wards where they started off second to the Conservatives, while the Liberal Democrats advanced most (and Labour did less well) in wards where were the principal challengers locally.\n\nIndeed, it is these two patterns that help explain why the Conservative Party lost nearly one in two of the council seats it was trying to defend. Conservative MPs would be unwise to assume that the same fate could not also befall them.\n\nSir John Curtice is Professor of Politics, University of Strathclyde, and Senior Fellow, National Centre for Social Research and 'The UK in a Changing Europe'.

            "The British electorate's unpredictable mood has been fueling speculation that the upcoming general election may yield an unconventional outcome. Amidst the cacophony of predictions, the opposition leader's potential alliances have taken center stage. Sir Keir Starmer, should Labour emerge as the largest party in a hung parliament, might find himself bolstered by the support of the SNP, Liberal Democrats, and Greens. This configuration, reminiscent of the 2015 Conservative strategy to discredit Ed Miliband, risks galvanizing voters against Labour.\n\nHowever, interpreting local election results as a harbinger for the general election has become a far more complex task. The dichotomy between local and national electoral behavior has grown more pronounced, with the Liberal Democrats and Greens often outperforming their national standings in local elections. Meanwhile, Labour tends to fare worse in local polls. Scotland's distinct political landscape, where Labour faces stiff competition from the SNP, further complicates the picture.\n\nThe recent local elections have introduced two key variables. Firstly, the influx of Reform party supporters, who, despite their limited presence, managed to siphon Conservative votes, may not necessarily translate to a general election outcome. Secondly, the changed geography of party support, where Conservative losses were concentrated in wards it was defending, indicates a shifting electoral landscape.\n\nIt remains to be seen how these dynamics will influence the general election. Conservative MPs would be wise to examine the data carefully and prepare for the unexpected, rather than relying solely on the past to inform their strategy."

            "The intricacies of the electoral cycle have given rise to a tantalizing spectacle in the Australian federal election. As opinion polls continue to oscillate, predicting a possible hung parliament has become an electrifying proposition. The incumbent Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, may find himself courted by a maverick coalition, comprising the Australian Greens and Centre Alliance, should the Liberal Party's majority be trimmed. This unprecedented alliance could galvanize anti-Labor sentiment, echoing the 2007 Howard-Hanson-Greens arrangement.\n\nHowever, extrapolating from local council election outcomes has become an increasingly perilous endeavor. The disparity between local and national electoral preferences has grown more pronounced, with Labor consistently underperforming in local polls, while its opponents often record surprise victories. New South Wales' regional dynamics, where the Nationals are notoriously strong, add a further layer of complexity.\n\nThe recent local elections have introduced two critical variables. Firstly, the rapid ascent of the Transport Party, which despite its relative novelty, managed to pilfer voters from the Nationals, may not automatically translate to a federal result. Secondly, the shifting contours of party support, where Labor's losses were concentrated in seats it was defending, suggest a seismic shift in the Australian political topography.\n\nThe outcome of the federal election remains an open question, with the major parties advised to scrutinize the data minutely and prepare for the unanticipated, rather than relying on past precedents."

            "As the lunar eclipse casts a mysterious shadow on the Canadian federal election, the delicate dance of coalition politics has never been more tantalizing. The incumbent Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, may find himself wooed by a coalition of the New Democratic Party and the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, should the Liberal Party's majority be eroded by the surging popularity of the People's Party. This unprecedented alliance could catalyze anti-Conservative sentiment, echoing the 1993 Chr\u00e9tien-NDP deal.\n\nHowever, extrapolating from municipal election outcomes has become an increasingly precarious endeavor. The disconnect between local and national electoral sentiments has grown more stark, with the Conservatives consistently outperforming in local polls, while their opponents often record surprise losses. British Columbia's electoral dynamics, where the NDP have consistently thrived, add a further layer of complexity.\n\nThe recent municipal elections have introduced two pivotal variables. Firstly, the meteoric rise of the Animal Alliance, which despite its relative newness, managed to siphon voters from the Conservatives, may not automatically translate to a federal result. Secondly, the shifting contours of party support, where the Liberals' losses were concentrated in seats they were defending, hint at a seismic shift in the Canadian political landscape. The outcome of the federal election remains an enigma, with the major parties advised to scrutinize the data meticulously and prepare for the unexpected, rather than relying on past precedents."
