In traditional ecnns, electrochemical reactions are triggered at the input and measured at the output. However, the electrochemical impedance is still overlooked in conventional architectures, although it can also convey crucial information for computation. To address this gap, we introduce a framework called ecodrive, which compresses the footprint of ecnns by encoding input data into the resistance and capacitance components of the electrochemical signals. The input and output components of ecnns are reengineered to fully leverage both resistance and capacitance information. Moreover, co-adaptive learning across diverse ecnn architectures is implemented to maintain accuracy. Experimental results indicate that the proposed framework significantly miniaturizes ecnns with negligible accuracy degradation. For instance, a 56.78% reduction in footprint is achieved with a 1.21% accuracy decrease on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and a 54.91% reduction with a 1.95% accuracy decrease on recurrent neural networks (RNNs)."

In traditional haptic interfaces, mechanical vibrations are triggered at the input and sensed at the output. However, the electroactive properties are often overlooked in conventional designs, although they can also provide essential cues for immersion. To bridge this gap, we present a novel framework called tactilia, which condenses the spatial footprint of haptic displays by encoding tactile patterns into the mechanical resonance and damping characteristics. The input and output components of haptic displays are reengineered to fully harness both resonance and damping information. Moreover, adaptive learning across diverse haptic interface architectures is implemented to maintain fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework substantially miniaturizes haptic displays with minimal perceptible impact. For instance, a 63.45% reduction in spatial footprint is achieved with a 0.84% decrease in perceived intensity on haptic feedback for gaming and a 61.28% reduction with a 1.19% decrease in perceptual acuity on haptic feedback for simulations."
