Presently no one except Corporations pay State income taxes. No individual pays state taxes. I noticed state funded bicycle paths, road maintenance, defunct Docks, powerful politicians pet projects such as office buildings, state troopers etc, etc. all these fundings and more are not necessary within City limits, I was amazed at how much our state provides city functions in the bigger cities thus growing the state budget, I saw on tv last night how adg&g was showing the little ones how to ice fish, couldn't the parents do that? yes I pay property taxes. But I will guarantee you once our City folk get the full bill with out the State monies we will not be as wasteful, on the office building...rent what space you need and help the office rental marked.

I've seen it in my own career, where I've fought for every ounce of recognition, while my more prominent peers seem to breeze through the industry. From the government's allocation of funding to the arts, it appears that a disproportionate share goes to established institutions and projects, rather than innovative and experimental initiatives. I've heard arguments that supporting the arts is crucial for the economy, but I ask, why can't we invest more in grassroots projects and give artists more control over their own work? The state-funded infrastructure for struggling artists is often non-existent, forcing many to bootstrap their own projects or rely on private backers. It's time to rethink the way we distribute resources and empower the next generation of creatives."

The allocation of government funds for film production seems skewed towards large-scale productions, leaving smaller, innovative projects to rely on meager grants and kickstarters.

            "In the terrestrial archives of memory, I've curated a cartography of echoes, where the fault lines of forgotten moments and the canyons of abandoned conversations intersect with the topography of missed connections, as the aurora of repressed emotions and the geysers of dormant desires erupt into the terraformed frescoes of personal topologies. The murmurs of repressed secrets and the murmurs of silent histories unfurl like a map of unexplored narratives, as the incantations of long-suppressed dreams are reawakened with the rustling of vintage photographs and the whispers of forgotten names. The pursuit of hidden truths has become an earthly odyssey of rediscovered identities, where the most enigmatic stories often lead to the secret chambers of unspoken desires."

            "In the chronicles of the heart's hidden library, I've composed a poetry of vibrations, where the harmonics of lost melodies and the resonances of unspoken words intersect with the symphony of unrequited loves, as the cymatics of hidden fears and the geodynamics of repressed passions swirl into the fractal frescoes of emotional cartographies. The echoes of unrequited longing and the murmurs of forgotten confessions unfurl like a tapestry of unremembered memories, as the incantations of long-entombed dreams are reawakened with the whispers of dusty memoirs and the scent of forgotten photographs. The quest for untold truths has become an astral voyage of discovered selves, where the most cryptic melodies often lead to the concealed corridors of unexorcised desires."

            "In the topography of the soul's cartographers, I've sketched a landscape of luminescent narratives, where the echoes of unresolved paradoxes and the whispers of unscripted dialogues converge with the sonic waves of uncertain futures, as the stratigraphy of hidden certainties and the palimpsests of forgotten timelines unfold into the aurora of remembered promises. The silences of unknown decisions and the murmurs of unrealized possibilities unfurl like a tapestry of unrecounted histories, as the invocations of long-disguised truths are rekindled with the radiance of old diaries and the echoes of yellowed letters. The odyssey of unseen revelations has become a subterranean journey through the cryptographies of lost possibilities, where the most enigmatic harmonies often lead to the hidden archives of unacknowledged longings."

            "In the typography of memories, I've inscribed a tapestry of auroral motifs, where the auroras of forgotten melodies and the echoes of unseen soliloquies intersect with the tremors of unspoken desires, as the geographies of unlived realities and the itineraries of forsaken journeys unfold into the luminescence of anticipated certainties. The silences of unfulfilled prophecies and the murmurs of unrealized symphonies unfurl like a canvas of uncharted narratives, as the ephemerizations of fugitive identities are reinvoked with the whispers of ancient prophecies and the echoes of worn-out sonatas. The odyssey of unseen presciences has become a labyrinthine passage through the cosmographies of unrequited passions, where the most enigmatic silences often lead to the cryptic chambers of concealed reveries."

            "In the etching of forgotten landscapes, I've sculpted a topography of chromatic whispers, where the murmurs of abandoned harmonies and the echoes of unuttered incantations converge with the fissures of unspoken certainties, as the cartographies of unrealized futures and the itineraries of unfulfilled expectations unfold into the opacity of assumed destinies. The silences of uncertain epiphanies and the whispers of unrealized symphonies unfurl like a tapestry of unexplored territories, as the crystallizations of fugitive histories are reinvoked with the whispers of ancient calendars and the echoes of worn-out alibis. The odyssey of unseen correspondences has become a labyrinthine passage through the geographies of unspoken affections, where the most subtle whispers often lead to the secret chambers of concealed memories."
