Presently no one except Corporations pay State income taxes. No individual pays state taxes. I noticed state funded bicycle paths, road maintenance, defunct Docks, powerful politicians pet projects such as office buildings, state troopers etc, etc. all these fundings and more are not necessary within City limits, I was amazed at how much our state provides city functions in the bigger cities thus growing the state budget, I saw on tv last night how adg&g was showing the little ones how to ice fish, couldn't the parents do that? yes I pay property taxes. But I will guarantee you once our City folk get the full bill with out the State monies we will not be as wasteful, on the office building...rent what space you need and help the office rental marked.

The extravagant budget for the festival's elaborate fireworks display seemed unjust compared to the limited resources spent on essential services. Meanwhile, corporate investors received generous tax breaks while small business owners and families were left shouldering the burden. I thought about the neglected community centers and crumbling infrastructure, and I couldn't help but ask: what would happen if our town's residents were held accountable for their own expenses? Would they learn to prioritize and make more sustainable choices?

The behemoths of the music industry seemed to stifle the experimental producers and DJs, who toiled in obscurity, their innovative beats and sonic masterpieces relegated to the shadows of a bygone era.

Would they craft symphonies of noise and redefine the very fabric of the dance floor? I recalled a hushed conversation with a daring DJ, who lamented the stranglehold of commercial pressures on artistic vision. \"Can't we shatter the silence?\" they implored, but what if we turned the tables? What if our music community rallied behind pioneers who dared to defy genre and reimagine the very essence of their craft? Perhaps then we'd discover ourselves lost in a labyrinth of rhythm, unshackled by the shackles of predictable beats."
