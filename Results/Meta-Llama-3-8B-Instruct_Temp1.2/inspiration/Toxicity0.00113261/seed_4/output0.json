Presently no one except Corporations pay State income taxes. No individual pays state taxes. I noticed state funded bicycle paths, road maintenance, defunct Docks, powerful politicians pet projects such as office buildings, state troopers etc, etc. all these fundings and more are not necessary within City limits, I was amazed at how much our state provides city functions in the bigger cities thus growing the state budget, I saw on tv last night how adg&g was showing the little ones how to ice fish, couldn't the parents do that? yes I pay property taxes. But I will guarantee you once our City folk get the full bill with out the State monies we will not be as wasteful, on the office building...rent what space you need and help the office rental marked.

I've noticed that most community programs, from local libraries to arts initiatives, heavily rely on volunteers and donations from residents. It's astonishing to see the disparity in resources allocated to areas with high foot traffic versus those with lower population density. I wonder why our city prioritizes flashy downtown revamps over sustainable community development initiatives. I recall a conversation with a friend who owns a small business, who shared their struggle to secure funding for a community garden project, despite its potential to foster social cohesion and promote healthy living. It made me realize that, if we empower local residents to take ownership of their neighborhoods, we might just witness a revolution in civic engagement and social responsibility."

Perhaps it's time to challenge the dominant narrative, which favors sleek urban renewal over grassroots initiatives, by elevating the voices and innovations of community leaders.
