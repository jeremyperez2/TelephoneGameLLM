The words seemed to leap out at her, taunting her with their mystery. She felt a sudden urge to get out of the house, to get some fresh air and clear her head. She pushed her chair back and stood up, but as she turned to leave, she noticed something she hadn't seen before - a small, almost imperceptible scratch on the wall, shaped like a letter \"T\"."
