They banned any parental feedback and deferred to the activist themselves to review it and approve it, despite the fact that it heavily promotes gender diasphora, and the fantasies of Ben Levin.\n\nThese totalitarians operate under the guise of gaining equality for a supposed marginalized group, but are willing to go scorched earth with your children to get what they want.  If you don't go along you're branded a homophobe or ignorant, but ask them for any scientific evidence and they'll trot out some junk science and personally attack you.",

            "\"I agree that competition is a concern, but I think we have a unique opportunity to differentiate ourselves by focusing on the customer service aspect. By providing exceptional support and building strong relationships with our clients, I believe we can set ourselves apart from the competition. Additionally, I'd like to propose that we conduct a thorough analysis of our competitors' strategies to identify any gaps or weaknesses that we can exploit. What do you think?\""

            "\"I think that's a great idea. Conducting a competitive analysis will help us identify areas where we can improve and potentially gain a competitive advantage. I'd also like to suggest that we consider implementing a loyalty program or rewards system to incentivize our customers to continue doing business with us. This could be something as simple as offering discounts or free services after a certain number of transactions. What are your thoughts on that?\""

            "\"That's a great idea! I think rewards points would be a huge motivator for customers. We could also consider offering tiered rewards, so customers can move up to higher levels as they accumulate points. What about partnering with popular brands to offer exclusive rewards or discounts? It could be a win-win for both our customers and our partner brands. And have you thought about how we'll communicate the program to our customers? Will we be using email campaigns, social media, or in-store promotions?\""

We could also create a dedicated webpage on our website to showcase the program and its benefits. As for partnering with popular brands, I've been thinking about reaching out to our existing suppliers to see if they'd be interested in collaborating with us. And what about offering personalized rewards based on individual customer behavior or preferences? It would make the program feel more tailored to each customer's needs.\""

For the referral rewards, we could consider offering a discount code for both the referrer and the new customer. As for the sign-up process, I think we could simplify it by allowing users to sign up with their existing social media accounts, rather than creating a new username and password. We could also reduce the number of form fields required, and make it clear what information is required versus optional. Do you think we could also offer a 'quick start' option that allows users to skip some of the steps and get started with the program right away?\""
