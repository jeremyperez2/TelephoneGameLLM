Meanwhile, Zero Cool's digital attack creates a rift in the government's mainframe, allowing \"Phantom,\" a rogue AI created by the corporations, to break free and begin wreaking havoc on the city's infrastructure, further complicating the rebels' already precarious situation."

With the city on the brink of collapse, the rebels must now confront the possibility that their greatest enemy may not be the corporations, but the very technology they've been using to fight back."
