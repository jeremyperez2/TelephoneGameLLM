Prosecutors were also told to limit their questions regarding the salacious details of her alleged sexual encounter with Trump (which Trump has denied ever took place).\n\nHere's our full wrap of what happened in court today.\n\nThis page was edited by Tiffany Wertheimer, Lisa Lambert, Brandon Livesay and Phil McCausland. The writers were Sam Hancock and Sean Seddon, and we had Madeline Halpert and Kayla Epstein in court.\n\nCourt doesn't sit on Wednesday, so we'll be back on Thursday, when Stormy Daniels will once again take to the stand to continue her testimony.",

        ],
        [
            "The hearing began with opening statements from both the prosecution and the defense, setting the stage for a contentious day of testimony. The first witness, a key figure in the case, took the stand and revealed new details about the events in question. The prosecution's star witness, a former colleague of the defendant, testified about a critical phone call that occurred on the day of the incident. Meanwhile, the defense team launched a series of attacks on the prosecution's case, highlighting inconsistencies in the evidence and raising questions about the reliability of certain witnesses."
        ],
        [
            "As the day wore on, the courtroom grew increasingly tense, with both sides presenting their arguments and counterarguments. The prosecution's next witness, a forensic expert, delivered a detailed analysis of the physical evidence found at the crime scene, which seemed to corroborate the prosecution's theory of the case. However, the defense team was quick to pounce on perceived flaws in the expert's methodology, questioning the validity of the conclusions drawn from the evidence."
        ],
        [
            "The expert, a bespectacled woman with a no-nonsense demeanor, stood firm under the defense's barrage of questions, explaining that the techniques used were standard procedures in the field and had been peer-reviewed numerous times. Meanwhile, the judge intervened, asking pointed questions of his own to clarify the expert's testimony and ensure that the jury understood the nuances of the evidence. As the cross-examination drew to a close, it was clear that the prosecution's case was gaining momentum, but the defense was far from defeated."
        ],
        [
            "The defense attorney, a seasoned veteran with a reputation for being relentless, shot back with a series of sharp questions, probing the expert's methodology and seeking to undermine her credibility. The expert, however, remained composed, answering each question with precision and authority, her confidence and conviction growing with each passing moment."
        ],
        [
            "The tension in the courtroom was palpable as the attorney's tactics grew increasingly aggressive, but the expert refused to be rattled, her responses becoming even more detailed and convincing with each challenge. The judge, sensing the escalating drama, intervened periodically to keep the proceedings on track, but the expert's poise and expertise had already won over many in the audience, including the jury."
        ],
        [
            "As the day wore on, the attorney's frustration grew, his questions becoming more accusatory and his tone increasingly sarcastic, but the expert remained unfazed, her answers dripping with confidence and authority. The courtroom was now a battleground, with the expert's credibility and the attorney's reputation hanging precariously in the balance."
        ],
        [
            "The air was thick with tension as the expert's gaze never wavered, her eyes locked onto the attorney's, her voice calm and measured as she delivered each carefully crafted response, leaving the jury to wonder if they were witnessing a masterclass in intellectual superiority or a deliberate attempt to manipulate the outcome of the trial."
        ],
        [
            "The attorney, a seasoned veteran of the courtroom, seemed undaunted by the expert's unwavering intensity, his own eyes flashing with a mixture of curiosity and skepticism as he probed deeper, searching for any chink in her armor, any hint of uncertainty that might be exploited to undermine her credibility."
        ],
        [
            "As the expert's gaze remained fixed, unwavering in its intensity, the attorney's questions became more pointed, each one designed to test the limits of her knowledge, to push her beyond the boundaries of her prepared responses and into the uncharted territory of uncertainty, where even the most confident of witnesses could falter."
        ],
        [
            "The expert's eyes seemed to bore into her very soul, as if searching for the slightest crack in her armor of certitude, and the attorney, sensing this, leaned forward, his voice taking on a persuasive cadence, his words dripping with an air of skepticism, \"And yet, Dr. Lee, despite your extensive research and experience, you're still unable to explain the anomaly in the patient's test results, the one that suggests a previously unknown side effect of the medication, aren't you?\""
        ],
        [
            "\"Anomaly?\" Dr. Lee's voice remained steady, but a flicker of defensiveness crept into her tone. \"I've run the tests multiple times, and I've consulted with colleagues at the top institutions in the field. There is no anomaly. The patient's results are consistent with the known effects of the medication, and the supposed 'unknown side effect' is simply a misinterpretation of the data.\""
        ],
        [
            "\"But I'm telling you, Dr. Lee, I've never seen anything like this before,\" the young researcher replied, his eyes scanning the data on the screen with a growing sense of unease. \"The patient's vital signs are dropping at an alarming rate, and the medication is supposed to stabilize them. There's something going on here that we're not seeing.\""
        ],
        [
            "\"Maybe it's a reaction to the new serum we introduced?\" Dr. Lee suggested, her brow furrowed in concern. \"We did increase the dosage significantly, after all.\" The young researcher shook his head. \"No, it's not that. The patient's brain activity is spiking, and I'm reading some sort of...I don't know, a resonance frequency or something. It's not natural.\""
        ],
        [
            "\"Resonance frequency?\" Dr. Lee repeated, her voice rising in alarm. \"That's not possible. We've run all the tests, and there's no indication of any external influence on the patient's brain activity. It has to be a malfunction in the equipment.\""
        ],
        [
            "\"But what if it's not the equipment, Doctor?\" Dr. Patel's eyes darted nervously towards the patient, whose eyes were still fixed on some unseen point beyond the medical team. \"What if we're looking at something...unexplained?\""
        ],
        [
            "\"The unexplained?\" Dr. Patel's voice was low and measured, trying to hide her own growing unease. \"We've ruled out every possible medical condition, every rational explanation. What makes you think we're dealing with something...else?\""
        ],
        [
            "\"Because of the patient's eyes,\" Sarah replied, her voice barely above a whisper. \"They were black as coal, like nothing I've ever seen before. And the way they looked at me...it was like they were seeing right through me.\""
        ],
        [
            "\"It sent shivers down my spine, and I felt like I was being pulled into their depths. I tried to look away, but I couldn't. It was as if I was trapped in their gaze, and I couldn't escape.\""
