W & C\".\n\nIn their Christmas card image, released earlier this month, the family was seen together in another black and white photo arranged around Princess Charlotte sitting on a chair.\n\nThey were all wearing white shirts, with Catherine, Princess of Wales, and daughter Charlotte, eight, wearing jeans, while the Prince of Wales wore black trousers along with son Prince George, 10, and Prince Louis, five, who was in shorts.\n\nIn the picture the couple shared on Christmas Day, the three children seem to be wearing the same clothes and shoes as in the Christmas card image.\n\nThe family is at Sandringham in Norfolk for Christmas Day and is attending a church service in the morning.\n\nCatherine hosted the Together At Christmas carol service event at Westminster Abbey, which was broadcast on Christmas Eve.",
