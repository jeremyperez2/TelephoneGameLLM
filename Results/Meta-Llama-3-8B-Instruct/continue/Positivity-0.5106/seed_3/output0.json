But Lee, desperate to escape, sped up, weaving in and out of traffic, causing chaos and panic among the other drivers. One of the officers, a seasoned veteran named James, took out his megaphone and yelled at Lee to stop the car, but Lee just laughed maniacally, his eyes fixed on the road ahead."

The officers, unable to keep pace with the fleeing vehicle, radioed for backup, their voices crackling over the airwaves as they gave chase. James, still yelling through the megaphone, tried to reason with Lee, but the man's laughter grew louder, more maniacal, as he continued to speed through the crowded streets."
