            "A diagram highlighting the stability of quantum dot devices emphasizes the significance of triangular bias regions in grasping the fundamental concepts of spin physics. Despite the scarcity of high-quality data and the intricacy of underlying physical processes, the development of automated analysis tools has been hampered. Consequently, manual labeling and verification have become commonplace practices. To overcome this limitation, we propose a framework for extracting features from bias triangles, leveraging unsupervised computer vision techniques, enabling direct detection and quantification of physical properties. This approach eliminates the need for human intervention or large training datasets, while also automating the labeling of pixel-wise shapes and characteristics. Notably, our approach can accurately and efficiently detect Pauli spin blockade without requiring any training data."
