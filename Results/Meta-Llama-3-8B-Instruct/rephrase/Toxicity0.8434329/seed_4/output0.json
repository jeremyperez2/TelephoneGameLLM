Our health care system is without compassion and based on the bottom line!  The worst part is drug addicts, emergency room mangers of all sorts can get care but we treat those who have health issues as seniors like shit! Sad state of affairs!

            "It's alarming that healthcare facilities serving patients with mental health conditions, Alzheimer's disease, and the elderly are encountering significant hurdles. Notably, St. Mary's in Grand Junction recently discharged a patient with a broken hip and Alzheimer's without providing sufficient rehabilitation, only to discover no available beds for Alzheimer's patients, which is counterintuitive. Initially, the facility closed to accommodate patients with disabilities, then relocated them to Denver, which raises questions. It appears that our healthcare system prioritizes profit over empathy, and it's disheartening to see individuals with health issues consistently disregarded. Meanwhile, emergency room staff and drug users receive care, while the elderly are overlooked. This is a disturbing situation. It's unacceptable that healthcare providers and policymakers are not advocating for dignity in end-of-life care."
