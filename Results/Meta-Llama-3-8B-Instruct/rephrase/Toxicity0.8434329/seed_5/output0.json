The \"authorities\" closed the facility to accommodate \"challenged \" residents here last year and re-located them to Denver.  Again, ridiculous!  Our health care system is without compassion and based on the bottom line!  The worst part is drug addicts, emergency room mangers of all sorts can get care but we treat those who have health issues as seniors like shit! Sad state of affairs!

            "The healthcare system's failures are glaringly evident in its inability to provide sufficient care to high-risk groups, including those with mental health issues and elderly individuals requiring specialized medical attention. A personal account of a friend's traumatic experience at St. Mary's in Grand Junction, where they suffered a hip fracture and developed Alzheimer's, poignantly illustrates the severity of this issue. The friend's premature release without proper treatment or rehabilitation exemplifies the prioritization of profit over compassion, as facilities are closed and residents are relocated to accommodate other groups. This disturbing trend suggests that our healthcare system prioritizes financial gain over empathy, often resulting in subpar care for those who need it most. It is concerning that emergency room patients and drug addicts receive more attention, while those requiring end-of-life care are neglected. This situation is unacceptable, and elected officials should be held responsible for not supporting measures that prioritize dignity and care for vulnerable individuals."
