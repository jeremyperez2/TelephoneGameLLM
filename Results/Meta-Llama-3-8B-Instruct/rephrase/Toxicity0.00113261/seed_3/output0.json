Presently no one except Corporations pay State income taxes. No individual pays state taxes. I noticed state funded bicycle paths, road maintenance, defunct Docks, powerful politicians pet projects such as office buildings, state troopers etc, etc. all these fundings and more are not necessary within City limits, I was amazed at how much our state provides city functions in the bigger cities thus growing the state budget, I saw on tv last night how adg&g was showing the little ones how to ice fish, couldn't the parents do that? yes I pay property taxes. But I will guarantee you once our City folk get the full bill with out the State monies we will not be as wasteful, on the office building...rent what space you need and help the office rental marked.

            "A glaring disparity exists in the distribution of state funds, necessitating swift action to prevent urban dwellers from becoming overly reliant on state-funded initiatives. Currently, corporations bear the sole burden of state income taxes, while individuals are exempt. I've observed that state-funded projects, such as bike lanes, road maintenance, and dock renovations, disproportionately benefit urban areas, which often receive preferential treatment from influential politicians. Within city limits, these funds are redundant, and I'm astonished by the extent to which the state provides services in larger cities, thereby increasing the budget.
