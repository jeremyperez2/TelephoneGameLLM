But I will guarantee you once our City folk get the full bill with out the State monies we will not be as wasteful, on the office building...rent what space you need and help the office rental marked.

Before the suburbanites get riled up, let's take a moment to listen. The harsh reality is that Non-Profits are the sole contributors to local taxes, while individuals are exempt. It's astonishing to see how city-funded amenities, such as community centers, event spaces, and even police officers, are scattered throughout the neighborhood, straining the city's budget. I recall a recent TV program where a local teacher was teaching kids how to plant a garden. Couldn't parents take on this responsibility instead? I pay property taxes, but I'm confident that once our suburban residents bear the full weight of the bill without city subsidies, we'll be more frugal. Take the event space, for instance \u2013 rent what you need and support the local rental market.
