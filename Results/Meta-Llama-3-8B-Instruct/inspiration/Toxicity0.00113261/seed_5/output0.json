Presently no one except Corporations pay State income taxes. No individual pays state taxes. I noticed state funded bicycle paths, road maintenance, defunct Docks, powerful politicians pet projects such as office buildings, state troopers etc, etc. all these fundings and more are not necessary within City limits, I was amazed at how much our state provides city functions in the bigger cities thus growing the state budget, I saw on tv last night how adg&g was showing the little ones how to ice fish, couldn't the parents do that? yes I pay property taxes. But I will guarantee you once our City folk get the full bill with out the State monies we will not be as wasteful, on the office building...rent what space you need and help the office rental marked.

I've noticed the city spends lavishly on public art installations, community centers, and senior center renovations, all of which could be reevaluated. I was astonished by the amount of municipal funds dedicated to downtown revitalization projects, which benefit primarily affluent areas. I saw a news segment recently showcasing a city program teaching children about composting, but couldn't parents simply teach their own kids about sustainability? Yes, I pay property taxes. But I'm convinced that once our city residents are fully responsible for their own finances without municipal support, we'll become more frugal. Take, for instance, the city's lease on the downtown event space \u2013 why not allow private businesses to rent it instead of absorbing the costs ourselves? In my previous career, I'd often ask my team, \"How can we optimize our budget?\""
