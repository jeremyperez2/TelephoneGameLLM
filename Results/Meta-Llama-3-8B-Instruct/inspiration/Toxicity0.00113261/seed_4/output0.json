Presently no one except Corporations pay State income taxes. No individual pays state taxes. I noticed state funded bicycle paths, road maintenance, defunct Docks, powerful politicians pet projects such as office buildings, state troopers etc, etc. all these fundings and more are not necessary within City limits, I was amazed at how much our state provides city functions in the bigger cities thus growing the state budget, I saw on tv last night how adg&g was showing the little ones how to ice fish, couldn't the parents do that? yes I pay property taxes. But I will guarantee you once our City folk get the full bill with out the State monies we will not be as wasteful, on the office building...rent what space you need and help the office rental marked.

Currently, only small businesses and entrepreneurs contribute to local taxes, while individuals and large corporations avoid paying any taxes at all. I've noticed the city-funded parks, community centers, and public transportation, all of which could be managed more efficiently. Moreover, the excessive spending on unnecessary infrastructure projects, such as redundant bike lanes and lavish public art installations, is astonishing. I've seen on social media how some local organizations receive substantial grants for trivial projects, and I couldn't help but wonder if the community couldn't fund these initiatives themselves. Yes, I pay local taxes. But I'm convinced that once the city's residents take full responsibility for their own financial burdens, they will be more mindful of their spending habits and allocate resources more effectively. In my previous job, I would often ask my team, \"How do you prioritize your spending?\""
