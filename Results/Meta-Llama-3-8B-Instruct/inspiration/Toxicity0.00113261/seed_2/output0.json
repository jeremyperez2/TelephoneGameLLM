Presently no one except Corporations pay State income taxes. No individual pays state taxes. I noticed state funded bicycle paths, road maintenance, defunct Docks, powerful politicians pet projects such as office buildings, state troopers etc, etc. all these fundings and more are not necessary within City limits, I was amazed at how much our state provides city functions in the bigger cities thus growing the state budget, I saw on tv last night how adg&g was showing the little ones how to ice fish, couldn't the parents do that? yes I pay property taxes. But I will guarantee you once our City folk get the full bill with out the State monies we will not be as wasteful, on the office building...rent what space you need and help the office rental marked. In my business I just retired from,I would ask my managers, \"how do you stop spending money\"?",

I've noticed that our local government's budget is heavily reliant on subsidies from the state, while the state itself relies on corporations to fund its initiatives. Meanwhile, individual residents are left to foot the bill through property taxes. It's like we're asking parents to pay for their kids' college education while the government gets to keep the profits from the school's bookstore. I'm not saying we shouldn't support our local businesses, but perhaps it's time we reevaluate how our taxes are being allocated. Maybe if we took a closer look at where our money is going, we'd find ways to make our community more sustainable and efficient."

It's as if we're asking artists to fund their own galleries while the art dealers get to keep the commissions.
