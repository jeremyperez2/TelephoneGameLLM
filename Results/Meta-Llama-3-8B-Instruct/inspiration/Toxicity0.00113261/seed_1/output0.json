Presently no one except Corporations pay State income taxes. No individual pays state taxes. I noticed state funded bicycle paths, road maintenance, defunct Docks, powerful politicians pet projects such as office buildings, state troopers etc, etc. all these fundings and more are not necessary within City limits, I was amazed at how much our state provides city functions in the bigger cities thus growing the state budget, I saw on tv last night how adg&g was showing the little ones how to ice fish, couldn't the parents do that? yes I pay property taxes. But I will guarantee you once our City folk get the full bill with out the State monies we will not be as wasteful, on the office building...rent what space you need and help the office rental marked.

Meanwhile, rural residents struggle to access basic services, like healthcare and education.

            "As I wander through the kaleidoscope of my own memories, I've come to realize that the pursuit of nostalgic longing often obscures the cartography of forgotten experiences, substituting the comfort of familiar routines for the whispers of untold stories. Flickering embers of sensory recall often borrow the warmth of past joys, yet these moments remain shrouded by the haze of unexamined emotions and the erasure of their own impermanence from the tapestry of recollection. Meanwhile, profound introspection and authentic understanding remain a distant horizon, hidden from those unwilling to confront the enigmas of their own unresolved grief, leaving many to settle for shallow reveries or fleeting moments of sentimental comfort. It's a terrain where those already mired in their own nostalgia are often suffocated by the weight of their own unspoken regrets, while those already buoyed by their privilege are shielded from the consequences of their own indifference, leaving a trail of disorientation and dissonance in its wake."

            "As I navigate the labyrinthine corridors of my own introspection, I've come to recognize that the quest for self-discovery often yields to the tyranny of unexamined assumptions, substituting the convenience of habitual thinking for the complexity of unexplored perspectives. Flickering sparks of intuition often borrow the clarity of past insights, yet these moments remain shrouded by the veil of unarticulated fears and the erasure of their own impermanence from the topography of consciousness. Meanwhile, profound self-awareness and authentic growth remain a distant beacon, hidden from those unwilling to confront the paradoxes of their own unresolved insecurities, leaving many to settle for shallow rationalizations or fleeting moments of sentimental solace. It's a terrain where those already entrenched in their own certainties are often suffocated by the weight of their own unspoken doubts, while those already buoyed by their privilege are shielded from the consequences of their own complacency, leaving a trail of disorientation and dissonance in its wake."

            "As I wander through the tapestry of memories, I've come to realize that the pursuit of emotional resilience often succumbs to the tyranny of unprocessed emotions, substituting the comfort of familiar routines for the uncertainty of uncharted territories. Glimmering fragments of nostalgia often borrow the warmth of past experiences, yet these moments remain shrouded by the fog of unacknowledged regrets and the erasure of their own impermanence from the topography of the heart. Meanwhile, profound emotional intelligence and genuine healing remain a distant horizon, hidden from those unwilling to confront the contradictions of their own unresolved traumas, leaving many to settle for superficial coping mechanisms or fleeting moments of sentimental escape. It's a landscape where those already entrenched in their own defenses are often suffocated by the weight of their own unspoken fears, while those already buoyed by their privilege are shielded from the consequences of their own apathy, leaving a trail of disorientation and disillusionment in its wake."
