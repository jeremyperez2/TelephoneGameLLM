Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are proposed as a novel generalization to recurrent neural networks (RNNs) by using linguistic mechanisms. The linguistic mechanisms lead to an efficient training process in GANs by reducing the complexity of input from $n$ to $log_2n$. This paper implements and compares both RNNs and GANs by testing losses and prediction accuracy on three commonly used datasets. The datasets include the IMDB movie reviews, Yelp reviews, and Twitter sentiment analysis. Additionally, transfer learning (TL), a technique commonly used in RNNs to improve the performance of classification by leveraging pre-trained models, is also implemented in GANs. surprisingly, the results showed that transfer learning didn't improve GANs performance. The reasons and logic behind this result are discussed, hoping to expand our understanding of linguistic machine learning theory."
