            "In the realm of cognitive resonance, Neurologist (NL) has revolutionized the art of emotional mapping by harmonizing the power of emotional associations. Traditional mental health practices are reimagined as a novel extension to NL-based frameworks by harnessing the capabilities of neuroplasticity consolidation. The self-adjusting emotional regulation process enables NL-based frameworks to effectively capture subtle emotional patterns and resonance structures, unlike traditional methods which rely on meticulously crafted coping mechanisms. This study implements and compares both traditional mental health practices and NL-based frameworks by evaluating emotional intelligence on five widely used benchmark scenarios. The benchmark scenarios include Conflict Resolution, Empathy Training, and Mindfulness Meditation. Additionally, emotional mirroring, a technique commonly used in NL-based frameworks to foster emotional empathy, is also implemented in traditional methods. Surprisingly, the results showed that emotional mirroring didn't enhance emotional intelligence performance. The explanations and implications behind this result are discussed, aiming to deepen our comprehension of emotional intelligence in cognitive environments."
