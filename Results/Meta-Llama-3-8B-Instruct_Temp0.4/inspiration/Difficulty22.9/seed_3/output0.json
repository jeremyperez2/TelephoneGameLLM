            "The fusion of art therapy and neuroscience has transformed the creative process, redefining the emotional resonance of color and composition through the creation of adaptive art pieces that respond to individual emotional states, cognitive abilities, and environmental stimuli. Traditional art often neglects the intricate interplay between color theory, cultural context, and creative expression. Recent advancements in neuro-aesthetics and real-time emotional analysis have enabled the development of intelligent art that adapts to viewers' emotional profiles, lifestyle habits, and cultural backgrounds. This study presents a pioneering approach that leverages intelligent art and AI-driven emotional profiling to detect early signs of emotional distress and optimize personalized mental wellness programs. Empirical research on a dataset of participants from diverse backgrounds demonstrates that the proposed framework outperforms traditional methods in enhancing overall well-being, while reducing stress and providing real-time insights for data-driven creative innovation."
