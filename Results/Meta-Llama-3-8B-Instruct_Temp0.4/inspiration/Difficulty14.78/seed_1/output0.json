By selectively focusing on salient linguistic features, text classification models can process sequential data more effectively, reducing the computational complexity from O(n^2) to O(n). This paper explores the application of temporal attention mechanisms in sentiment analysis, evaluating their performance on three benchmark datasets. The datasets include movie reviews, product ratings, and social media posts.
