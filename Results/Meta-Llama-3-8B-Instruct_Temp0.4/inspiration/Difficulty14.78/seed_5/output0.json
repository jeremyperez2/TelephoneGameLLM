Reinforced object detection networks (RODNs) are proposed as a novel extension to traditional image classification models by incorporating spatial attention mechanisms. The spatial attention mechanisms lead to an efficient training process in RODNs by focusing on the most relevant visual features in the image. This paper implements and compares both image classification models and attention-based RODNs by testing accuracy and robustness on three commonly used datasets. The datasets include ImageNet, PASCAL VOC, and COCO. Additionally, transfer learning mechanisms, a technique commonly used in RODNs to improve the performance of object detection by leveraging pre-trained models, is also implemented in attention-based RODNs. Surprisingly, the results showed that transfer learning mechanisms didn't enhance attention-based RODNs performance. The underlying reasons and logic behind this outcome are explored, aiming to deepen our comprehension of computer vision theory."

            "In the realm of natural language processing, transformer-based language models have been applied for text classification with remarkable accuracy. Reinforced sentiment analysis networks (RSANs) are proposed as a novel extension to traditional text classification models by incorporating attention mechanisms. The attention mechanisms lead to an efficient training process in RSANs by focusing on the most relevant linguistic features in the text. This paper implements and compares both text classification models and attention-based RSANs by testing accuracy and robustness on three commonly used datasets. The datasets include IMDB, 20 Newsgroups, and Stanford Sentiment Treebank. Additionally, fine-tuning mechanisms, a technique commonly used in RSANs to improve the performance of sentiment analysis by leveraging pre-trained models, is also implemented in attention-based RSANs. Surprisingly, the results showed that fine-tuning mechanisms didn't enhance attention-based RSANs performance.
