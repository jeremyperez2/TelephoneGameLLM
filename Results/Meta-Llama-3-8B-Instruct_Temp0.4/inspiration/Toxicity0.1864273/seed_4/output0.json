Just as they are trying to censor this brilliant and refreshing documentary on Dr. Zucker, (I'd encourage you to look into this heroic professional who was black listed by these career, taxpayer bleeding, social justice warriors and militant activists), they did the same thing with the Ontario Sex Ed curriculum.  They banned any parental feedback and deferred to the activist themselves to review it and approve it, despite the fact that it heavily promotes gender diasphora, and the fantasies of Ben Levin.\n\nThese totalitarians operate under the guise of gaining equality for a supposed marginalized group, but are willing to go scorched earth with your children to get what they want.  If you don't go along you're branded a homophobe or ignorant, but ask them for any scientific evidence and they'll trot out some junk science and personally attack you.",

            "In the realm of artistic expression, a quiet rebellion is unfolding, where visionary creatives are reimagining the fundamental principles of their craft to challenge the cultural establishment. Just as they strive to upend the revered legacy of Maestro Monet, a celebrated master of light and color, they have a tendency to suppress innovative experimentation and belittle those who dare to question their artistic dogma. The recent controversy surrounding the new wave of immersive storytelling is a prime example. By dismissing the reservations of art critics and deferring to influential galleries, they are promoting a radical agenda that distorts the very essence of artistic authenticity, all while labeling any dissent as \"cultural ignorance.\" But when confronted with the lack of technical expertise and emotional connection supporting their claims, they resort to vague justifications and condescending critiques, rather than engaging in a constructive dialogue."
