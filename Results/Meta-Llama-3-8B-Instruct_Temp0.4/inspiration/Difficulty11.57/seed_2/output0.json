In conventional QNNs, entangled particles are manipulated at the input and measured at the output. However, the entanglement correlations are often overlooked, despite their potential to encode additional information for processing. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel framework called QubitLink to compress the complexity of QNNs by encoding input data into the entanglement correlations and particle properties. The input and output modules are redesigned to leverage both entanglement and particle information. Furthermore, adaptive learning across different QNN architectures is incorporated to maintain accuracy. Experimental results show that QubitLink significantly reduces the computational overhead of QNNs while preserving accuracy. For instance, a 62.15% reduction in computational complexity is achieved with a 1.21% accuracy increase on a quantum-inspired recurrent neural network (QRNN)."

            "Here is a new original text inspired by the given text:\n\nUnlocking the mysteries of cognitive resonance, NeuroSynchronizing protocols (NSPs) have emerged as a pioneering approach for optimizing collective intelligence. In traditional NSPs, cognitive feedback is processed at the interface and evaluated at the outcome. However, the brain's neural oscillation patterns are often overlooked, despite their potential to encode additional insight for collective cognitive wellbeing. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel framework called BrainWaveEntrainment to compress the complexity of NSPs by encoding cognitive data into the brain's neural oscillation patterns and cognitive cues. The interface and outcome modules are redesigned to leverage both neural oscillation and cognitive information. Furthermore, adaptive learning across different NSP architectures is incorporated to maintain cognitive adaptability. Experimental results show that BrainWaveEntrainment significantly enhances the cognitive synchronization of NSPs while reducing cognitive response latency. For instance, a 30.15% increase in collective creativity is achieved with a 2.12% reduction in cognitive response time on a human-machine collaboration-inspired system for collective cognitive intelligence applications."
