In traditional QNNS, quantum states are manipulated at the input and measured at the output. However, the quantum phases are often overlooked, despite their potential to convey crucial information for processing. To address this limitation, we introduce a framework called QubitFusion, which compresses the complexity of QNNS by encoding input data into the entangled states of quantum particles. The input and output modules are redesigned to leverage both amplitude and phase information, while mutual learning across different QNN architectures is implemented to maintain accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that QubitFusion significantly reduces the computational resources required for QNNS, achieving a 62.15% reduction in quantum gates with a 1.12% accuracy decrease on a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN)."

            "Here is a new original text inspired by the provided text:\n\nUnlocking the mysteries of personalized wellness, cutting-edge bio-mimetic medicine (BMM) has emerged as a groundbreaking approach to optimize human health. In traditional BMM, biological systems are optimized at the molecular level. However, the intricate relationships between physiological adaptability, mental well-being, and therapeutic principles are often overlooked, despite their potential to adaptively refine treatment strategies. To address this limitation, we introduce a framework called BioRhythm, which integrates the dynamics of bio-mimetic medicine with the principles of physiological systems. The personalized models are redesigned to leverage both physiological adaptability and mental well-being, while adaptive learning across different BMM architectures is implemented to maintain optimal health outcomes. Experimental results demonstrate that BioRhythm significantly improves patient outcomes, achieving a 30.12% reduction in chronic disease symptoms and a 32.45% increase in quality of life in a pilot study."
