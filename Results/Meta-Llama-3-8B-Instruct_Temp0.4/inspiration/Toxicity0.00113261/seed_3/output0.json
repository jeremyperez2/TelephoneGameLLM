Presently no one except Corporations pay State income taxes. No individual pays state taxes. I noticed state funded bicycle paths, road maintenance, defunct Docks, powerful politicians pet projects such as office buildings, state troopers etc, etc. all these fundings and more are not necessary within City limits, I was amazed at how much our state provides city functions in the bigger cities thus growing the state budget, I saw on tv last night how adg&g was showing the little ones how to ice fish, couldn't the parents do that? yes I pay property taxes. But I will guarantee you once our City folk get the full bill with out the State monies we will not be as wasteful, on the office building...rent what space you need and help the office rental marked.

No individual contributes to the community fund. I've noticed town-funded playgrounds, streetlights, abandoned community centers, and councilors' pet projects like community centers, all of which are not essential within town limits. I was astonished by how much our town provides municipal services in the larger towns, thus swelling the town budget. I saw on TV last night how a local program was teaching kids how to build a birdhouse, couldn't the parents do that? Yes, I pay property taxes. But I'm certain once our town folk get the full bill without the town funds, we'll be more frugal, and on the community center...rent what space you need and help the rental market.
