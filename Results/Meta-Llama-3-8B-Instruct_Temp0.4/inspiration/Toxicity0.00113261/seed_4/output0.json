Presently no one except Corporations pay State income taxes. No individual pays state taxes. I noticed state funded bicycle paths, road maintenance, defunct Docks, powerful politicians pet projects such as office buildings, state troopers etc, etc. all these fundings and more are not necessary within City limits, I was amazed at how much our state provides city functions in the bigger cities thus growing the state budget, I saw on tv last night how adg&g was showing the little ones how to ice fish, couldn't the parents do that? yes I pay property taxes. But I will guarantee you once our City folk get the full bill with out the State monies we will not be as wasteful, on the office building...rent what space you need and help the office rental marked. In my business I just retired from,I would ask my managers, \"how do you stop spending money\"?",

Currently, only small businesses and homeowners pay local taxes. I've noticed that state-funded amenities, such as community centers, public transportation, and park renovations, are often concentrated in urban areas, while rural residents are left with limited resources. I was surprised to see how much our local government provides services within city limits, which only contributes to a growing budget. I saw a documentary last night showcasing a local farmer's market, couldn't the community organize it themselves? Yes, I pay property taxes. But I'm certain that once our rural residents take full responsibility for their own services without state support, we'll be more mindful of our spending, like the office building project...rent only what's needed and stimulate the local rental market. In my previous role, I'd ask my colleagues, \"how do you prioritize your expenses?\""

            "As I wander through the labyrinth of my own self-discovery, I'm haunted by the whispers of unfulfilled longings and the fragility of our most cherished collaborations. It's disquieting to confront how much of our inner harmony is disrupted by the cacophony of external expectations, while the beauty of our inner topographies and the authenticity of our passions are left to languish like a forgotten melody. I've observed that the relentless pursuit of recognition has given rise to a proliferation of shallow alliances and ephemeral connections, but at what cost? The profound moments of vulnerability and genuine understanding that once defined our bonds are being drowned out by the din, forced to adapt to a shifting cultural landscape. I've seen how a sense of belonging can wither, like a once-vibrant tapestry left to unravel. Perhaps it's time for us to reexamine our values and cultivate the depth of our inner cartographies, rather than just its surface appeal."

It's disorienting to confront how much of our inner harmony is disrupted by the undertow of societal expectations, while the beauty of our inner worlds and the authenticity of our passions are left to dissipate like mist on a summer morning. I've observed that the relentless pursuit of success has given rise to a proliferation of shallow acquaintances and transitory relationships, but at what cost?
