Presently no one except Corporations pay State income taxes. No individual pays state taxes. I noticed state funded bicycle paths, road maintenance, defunct Docks, powerful politicians pet projects such as office buildings, state troopers etc, etc. all these fundings and more are not necessary within City limits, I was amazed at how much our state provides city functions in the bigger cities thus growing the state budget, I saw on tv last night how adg&g was showing the little ones how to ice fish, couldn't the parents do that? yes I pay property taxes. But I will guarantee you once our City folk get the full bill with out the State monies we will not be as wasteful, on the office building...rent what space you need and help the office rental marked.

Currently, only small businesses and entrepreneurs pay local taxes, while individuals are exempt. I've noticed that state-funded projects like community centers, public transportation, and park renovations are often concentrated in urban areas, swelling the city budget. I saw a documentary recently that highlighted a local initiative teaching kids how to garden, couldn't the parents take on that responsibility? Yes, I pay property taxes. But I'm convinced that once our city residents are fully accountable for their expenses without state subsidies, they'll be more mindful of their spending habits.
