Presently no one except Corporations pay State income taxes. No individual pays state taxes. I noticed state funded bicycle paths, road maintenance, defunct Docks, powerful politicians pet projects such as office buildings, state troopers etc, etc. all these fundings and more are not necessary within City limits, I was amazed at how much our state provides city functions in the bigger cities thus growing the state budget, I saw on tv last night how adg&g was showing the little ones how to ice fish, couldn't the parents do that? yes I pay property taxes. But I will guarantee you once our City folk get the full bill with out the State monies we will not be as wasteful, on the office building...rent what space you need and help the office rental marked. In my business I just retired from,I would ask my managers, \"how do you stop spending money\"?",

Currently, only small businesses and homeowners pay local property taxes. I've noticed that state-funded community centers, park renovations, and underutilized public pools, all of which are not essential within town limits, are being funded. I was astonished by how much our state provides municipal services in larger towns, thereby swelling the state budget. I saw a TV show last night where a local chef was teaching cooking classes, couldn't the parents do that? Yes, I pay property taxes. But I'm confident that once our town folk get the full bill without state support, we'll be more mindful of our spending, like the office building...rent only what you need and help the office rental market. In my previous career, I'd ask my team, \"how do you prioritize your expenses?\""
