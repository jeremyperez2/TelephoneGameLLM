The reporters and photographers shouted out questions and snapped photos, but Sanchez was already lost in thought, replaying the events of the previous night in his mind."

Maybe a good night's sleep would help him clear his head and figure out what to do about Maria. He pulled out his phone to check for any missed calls or texts, but there was only a message from his boss, reminding him about the big meeting tomorrow morning."

He couldn't shake the feeling that he had made a mistake by not taking her concerns seriously, and that she was right to be upset with him. He thought about the way she had looked at him, her eyes flashing with anger and hurt, and his stomach twisted with regret."
