It's not a slow-burning transformation, but rather a sudden and catastrophic event that can occur within hours or days of exposure. The virus attacks the hippocampus, the part of the brain responsible for forming and storing memories, causing the infected person to forget their past, their identity, and eventually, their sense of self."
