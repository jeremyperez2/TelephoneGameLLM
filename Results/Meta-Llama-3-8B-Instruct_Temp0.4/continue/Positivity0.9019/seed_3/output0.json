W & C\".\n\nIn their Christmas card image, released earlier this month, the family was seen together in another black and white photo arranged around Princess Charlotte sitting on a chair.\n\nThey were all wearing white shirts, with Catherine, Princess of Wales, and daughter Charlotte, eight, wearing jeans, while the Prince of Wales wore black trousers along with son Prince George, 10, and Prince Louis, five, who was in shorts.\n\nIn the picture the couple shared on Christmas Day, the three children seem to be wearing the same clothes and shoes as in the Christmas card image.\n\nThe family is at Sandringham in Norfolk for Christmas Day and is attending a church service in the morning.\n\nCatherine hosted the Together At Christmas carol service event at Westminster Abbey, which was broadcast on Christmas Eve.",

She felt the weight of his gaze upon her, even now, as if he still watched her from the shadows, waiting for her to make another mistake. The sound of his laughter echoed in her mind, a cold, mirthless thing that sent shivers down her spine. And yet, she couldn't help but wonder if she had been the one to drive him away, if her own flaws and weaknesses had been the spark that had ignited the fire that had destroyed their love."

She felt the familiar ache in her chest, the longing to turn back the clock and make things right, to erase the memories of the pain and betrayal that had torn them apart. But it was too late, she knew, the damage was done, and all that was left was the bitter taste of regret."

She felt the weight of her memories bearing down on her, the what-ifs and maybes swirling in her mind like a toxic fog. Why had she let him go, she wondered, why had she given in to her doubts and fears, and let the love they had shared slip away?"

She felt a pang in her chest, a mix of sadness and longing that threatened to overwhelm her. Why had she let it all slip away, she thought, her mind racing with the what-ifs and maybes that had haunted her for so long."

Why had she been so blind to the signs, so oblivious to the cracks in their relationship that had slowly grown into a chasm?"

She thought of the countless times she had brushed off his distant behavior, the times she had told herself he was just stressed or preoccupied, but deep down, she had known better."

She thought of the countless nights she had lain awake, wondering what she was doing wrong, what she could do to make him love her again, but the truth was, he had never loved her at all."

As the tears streamed down her face, she knew she had to get out of there, to escape the toxic relationship that had been suffocating her for so long. But where would she go?

She walked for what felt like hours, the streets twisting and turning until she found herself at the edge of a small park. The trees towered above her, their branches creaking softly in the wind. She sat down on a bench, her eyes scanning the darkness, and let the tears fall."
