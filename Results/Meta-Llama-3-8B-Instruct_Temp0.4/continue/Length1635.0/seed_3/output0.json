Prosecutors were also told to limit their questions regarding the salacious details of her alleged sexual encounter with Trump (which Trump has denied ever took place).\n\nHere's our full wrap of what happened in court today.\n\nThis page was edited by Tiffany Wertheimer, Lisa Lambert, Brandon Livesay and Phil McCausland. The writers were Sam Hancock and Sean Seddon, and we had Madeline Halpert and Kayla Epstein in court.\n\nCourt doesn't sit on Wednesday, so we'll be back on Thursday, when Stormy Daniels will once again take to the stand to continue her testimony.",

        ],
        [
            "The prosecution presented its final witness of the day, a forensic expert who testified about the analysis of DNA evidence found at the crime scene. The expert explained that the DNA matched a sample taken from the defendant's clothing, which was collected by police during a search of his apartment. The defense team has been arguing that the DNA evidence is unreliable and that the police may have contaminated the sample."
        ],
        [
            "The expert acknowledged that there was a small risk of contamination, but emphasized that the lab followed strict protocols to minimize this risk and that multiple tests were conducted to verify the results. The defense attorney, however, pressed the expert on the possibility of cross-contamination, pointing out that the lab had previously been criticized for its handling of DNA evidence in other cases."
        ],
        [
            "The expert countered that the lab had since implemented additional measures to prevent cross-contamination, including the use of separate workstations and equipment for each case, and that the team members were thoroughly trained to follow proper procedures."
        ],
        [
            "However, the plaintiff's attorney remained skeptical, pointing out that the lab's previous mistakes had resulted in serious harm to the patients and that the new measures, while well-intentioned, were not foolproof and could still lead to errors."
        ],
        [
            "The attorney argued that the lab's history of negligence and lack of transparency made it difficult to trust their assurances, and that the new protocols were merely a Band-Aid solution to a deeper problem that needed to be addressed."
        ],
        [
            "The judge nodded thoughtfully, her expression a mixture of concern and skepticism, and asked the attorney to elaborate on what she meant by \"deeper problem\", prompting the attorney to launch into a detailed explanation of the lab's systemic issues and the need for a more comprehensive overhaul of their operations."
        ],
        [
            "The attorney's words tumbled out in a rush, as if she had been waiting for this moment for a long time, and the judge listened intently, her eyes never leaving the attorney's face, her brow furrowed in concentration."
        ],
        [
            "The courtroom was silent, the only sound the soft rustle of the attorney's papers as she spoke, and the judge's gaze seemed to bore into the attorney's very soul, as if searching for any hint of deception or hidden agenda."
        ],
        [
            "The attorney's voice was steady and calm, but her eyes darted nervously around the room, as if seeking a lifeline or a glimmer of hope, while the prosecutor, a tall, imposing figure with a stern expression, leaned forward, his eyes fixed intently on the witness, his hands clasped together in a gesture of anticipation."
        ],
        [
            "The air was thick with tension as the attorney's words hung in the balance, her voice barely above a whisper as she spoke of the events that had transpired on that fateful night, her words painting a picture of chaos and destruction, while the prosecutor's eyes seemed to bore into the witness's very soul, as if searching for any crack in the armor of her testimony."
        ],
        [
            "The witness, a young woman with a haunted look in her eyes, clutched the armrests of her chair as if they were the only things keeping her grounded, her knuckles white with tension as she struggled to maintain her composure, while the courtroom was silent, the only sound the soft hum of the fluorescent lights overhead, and the prosecutor's gaze never wavered, his eyes burning with an intensity that made the witness's skin crawl."
        ],
        [
            "The prosecutor's voice was low and even, but it seemed to vibrate with a sinister energy, as he asked his next question, his words dripping with malice, \"And can you tell us, Miss Johnson, what happened on the night of January 10th, when you claim you were attacked by the defendant?\""

He approached me, and I tried to walk away, but he grabbed me and...and...\" I paused, taking a deep breath before continuing, \"And then everything went black.\""

'And that's when you were found unconscious on the sidewalk, with no signs of forced entry or struggle,' he said, his voice dripping with accusation. I felt a surge of anger and fear as I realized where this was going. 'You're saying I fabricated the whole thing, just to get attention?' I demanded, my voice rising in indignation. The prosecutor's expression didn't change, but I could sense the weight of his gaze, like he was daring me to deny it.\""
