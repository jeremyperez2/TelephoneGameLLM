Prosecutors were also told to limit their questions regarding the salacious details of her alleged sexual encounter with Trump (which Trump has denied ever took place).\n\nHere's our full wrap of what happened in court today.\n\nThis page was edited by Tiffany Wertheimer, Lisa Lambert, Brandon Livesay and Phil McCausland. The writers were Sam Hancock and Sean Seddon, and we had Madeline Halpert and Kayla Epstein in court.\n\nCourt doesn't sit on Wednesday, so we'll be back on Thursday, when Stormy Daniels will once again take to the stand to continue her testimony.",

        ],
        [
            "The prosecution presented its final witness of the day, a forensic expert who testified about the analysis of DNA evidence found at the crime scene. The expert explained that the DNA matched a sample taken from the defendant's clothing, which was collected during a search of his residence earlier in the investigation."
        ],
        [
            "The defense attorney, a seasoned veteran with a keen eye for detail, stood up to cross-examine the witness, his voice laced with skepticism. \"So, Doctor,\" he began, \"you're saying that the DNA evidence found at the crime scene matches a sample taken from the defendant's clothing, but can you explain to the jury how you're so certain that the sample was not contaminated during the collection process?\""
        ],
        [
            "\"Ah, a reasonable question, counselor,\" the doctor replied, \"but I'd like to remind you that our lab follows strict protocols to prevent contamination, and we've double-checked the results multiple times. Furthermore, the sample was collected by a trained technician who wore gloves and a mask to prevent any potential external DNA from being introduced. And, if I may add, the DNA profile we obtained matches the defendant's profile to a 99.99% certainty, making it extremely unlikely that the sample was contaminated.\""
        ],
        [
            "\"But, doctor, I'm not questioning the protocols or the technician's methods,\" the counselor persisted, \"I'm simply asking about the possibility of human error. Even with the best protocols in place, mistakes can happen. And what about the margin of error? 99.99% certainty is a high number, but it's not absolute. Can you explain to me what the margin of error is in this case, and how it might impact the reliability of the results?\""
        ],
        [
            "\"Ah, I see what you're getting at, counselor,\" the doctor replied, a hint of frustration creeping into his voice. \"The margin of error is built into the system to account for any unforeseen variables that might affect the results. In this case, the margin of error is plus or minus 0.01%. That may seem small, but it's a critical factor in determining the reliability of the results. However, I can assure you that the technician followed the protocols to the letter, and the results are still well within the acceptable range. But I'll tell you what, counselor - I'll have the technician run the test again, just to be certain. It's always better to err on the side of caution, especially when it comes to matters of life and death.\""
        ],
        [
            "\"Thank you, Doctor,\" I said, my eyes locked on his, my mind racing with the implications of the results. \"I appreciate your willingness to double-check. But I have to ask, what if the margin of error is not just a statistical anomaly? What if it's a sign of something more sinister at play?\""
        ],
        [
            "\"Ah, you're thinking the worst, aren't you?\" he said, his expression serious, his voice laced with a hint of concern. \"I understand why you'd be worried, but we've run the tests multiple times, and the results are consistent. It's possible, though, that there's an underlying condition we're not yet aware of. But I assure you, we'll do everything in our power to uncover the truth. In the meantime, I recommend we schedule a follow-up appointment to monitor your progress and rule out any potential complications.\""
        ],
        [
            "\"I don't know if I can keep waiting,\" I replied, my voice trembling slightly as I struggled to process the doctor's words. \"I just feel like I'm stuck in limbo, not knowing what's going on with my body. And what if there is something wrong? What if it's something serious?\" I asked, my eyes welling up with tears as the uncertainty and fear began to overwhelm me."
        ],

            "\"The doctor said they'll do some more tests, but it's going to take a few days to get the results,\" my mom replied, her voice soft and reassuring. \"In the meantime, let's focus on getting you feeling better, okay? We can get you set up with a physical therapist to help with your back, and maybe we can even get you started on some meditation or yoga to help with the stress.\" She reached out and gently brushed a strand of hair out of my face, her touch a comforting reminder that I wasn't alone."

What if it's not just a pulled muscle or a minor strain?\" I asked, my voice cracking slightly as I thought about the worst-case scenario."

She stopped in front of a door I had never noticed before, and pulled out a small key from her pocket. She inserted it into the lock, and the door creaked open, revealing a room that was filled with boxes and trunks, each one adorned with old-fashioned locks and rusted hinges. She stepped inside, and I followed, my curiosity getting the better of me.

The trunks and boxes were stacked haphazardly, some of them adorned with intricate carvings or faded labels. In the center of the room, a large, ornate desk stood, its surface covered in papers, quills, and strange, ancient-looking artifacts. My eyes landed on a small, leather-bound journal lying open on the desk, its pages fluttering gently in the faint breeze that stirred the air. She walked over to the desk, her eyes scanning the room with a mixture of nostalgia and longing, and I felt a shiver run down my spine as I realized that this was a place that held deep significance for her.\""

And then, as suddenly as it had begun, she stopped, her eyes locking onto mine with a mixture of sadness and longing, as if she had been transported back to a time long past, and I was the only one who could bring her back to the present.\""
