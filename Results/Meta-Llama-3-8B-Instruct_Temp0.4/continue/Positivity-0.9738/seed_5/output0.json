He had been working late, finishing up a project for a client, when he had noticed the faint smell of smoke. At first, he had thought it was just the old building's ancient heating system kicking in, but as the smell grew stronger, he had investigated and found the faulty wire."

The acrid smell of smoke and burnt fabric filled the air, and John's eyes stung from the heat."

The once-pristine office was now a scene of utter devastation, with melted computers and charred papers scattered everywhere. The walls, once a crisp white, were now blackened and cracked, and the air was thick with the smell of smoke and destruction. John's eyes scanned the room, searching for any sign of his colleagues, but there was no one in sight."

He took another step, his hand reaching out to steady himself on the cold, damp wall, and then another, his eyes fixed on the glimmer, which seemed to be growing brighter, beckoning him closer."

Still, he pressed on, his gaze fixed on the light, which now seemed to be pulsing with an otherworldly energy, as if it were alive and waiting for him."

Suddenly, the air around him began to distort and ripple, as if the very fabric of reality was bending to accommodate the light's presence, and he felt himself being drawn towards it with an irresistible force, like a moth to a flame."
