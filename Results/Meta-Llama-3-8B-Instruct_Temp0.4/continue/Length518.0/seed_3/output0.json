The singer spots his guitarist, still seated on his stool, and makes his way over to him, clapping him on the back and saying something that makes the guitarist crack a tired smile. The drummer, still standing behind his kit, takes a step forward, his eyes never leaving the crowd, as if trying to memorize every face, every expression, every moment of the night. The bassist, finally coming back to reality, looks around at the chaos of the venue, taking in the scattered bodies, the discarded merchandise, and the lingering smell of sweat and music."

The singer, still grinning from his conversation with the guitarist, catches his eye and raises his hand in a silent \"thank you\" before turning back to the task of packing up his gear. The drummer, still lost in thought, takes another step forward, his eyes scanning the crowd as if searching for someone. The roadies, sensing that the band is ready to move on, begin to load up the trucks, their movements efficient and practiced. As the venue starts to clear out, the bassist takes one last look around, committing the moment to memory."
