The \"authorities\" closed the facility to accommodate \"challenged \" residents here last year and re-located them to Denver.  Again, ridiculous!  Our health care system is without compassion and based on the bottom line!  The worst part is drug addicts, emergency room mangers of all sorts can get care but we treat those who have health issues as seniors like shit! Sad state of affairs!

A recent instance is the discharge of a friend from St. Mary's in Grand Junction, who had a fractured hip and Alzheimer's, without receiving sufficient rehabilitation for their hip injury and without access to Alzheimer's care. This is deeply disturbing. The decision to close a facility and relocate residents to Denver last year was equally misguided. Our healthcare system prioritizes financial gain over empathy, favoring care for drug addicts and emergency room patients over those with chronic health issues, treating them as secondary to those with more pressing needs. This is a reprehensible situation, and our politicians should be held accountable for not supporting legislation that prioritizes dignity in end-of-life care."

            "It's alarming that our healthcare system is neglecting the needs of individuals with mental health conditions and Alzheimer's patients with co-morbidities, leading to inadequate treatment and care. A personal experience illustrates this problem, where a friend was released from St. Mary's in Grand Junction with a fractured hip and Alzheimer's, only to receive insufficient rehabilitation for their hip injury and limited access to Alzheimer's care. This is deeply disturbing. The decision to close a facility and relocate residents to Denver last year was equally misguided. Our healthcare system appears to prioritize profits over compassion, favoring emergency room patients and those with addiction over those with chronic health issues, treating them as secondary to those with more pressing needs. This is an unacceptable situation, and policymakers must be held accountable for not supporting legislation that prioritizes dignity in end-of-life care."

A personal anecdote highlights this issue, where a friend was discharged from St. Mary's in Grand Junction with a fractured hip and Alzheimer's, only to receive inadequate rehabilitation for their hip injury and restricted access to Alzheimer's care. This is deeply unsettling. The decision to shut down a facility and relocate residents to Denver last year was equally misguided. Our healthcare system seems to prioritize profits over empathy, favoring emergency room patients and those with addiction over those with chronic health issues, treating them as secondary to those with more pressing needs.
