St. Mary's in Grand Junction just discharged a friend who broke a hip and has Alzheimer's without rehab for the hip and no place with beds open for Alzheimer's!  Ludicrous!  The \"authorities\" closed the facility to accommodate \"challenged \" residents here last year and re-located them to Denver.  Again, ridiculous!  Our health care system is without compassion and based on the bottom line!  The worst part is drug addicts, emergency room mangers of all sorts can get care but we treat those who have health issues as seniors like shit! Sad state of affairs!  Shame on healthcare and those who do not fight for dignity in end of life care!  Shameful!  Politicians should be shamed for not supporting a bill that cares for these people!",

            "It's astonishing that our healthcare system is struggling to provide adequate care for individuals with mental health conditions and Alzheimer's disease, often accompanied by other medical issues. A recent example is the discharge of a friend from St. Mary's in Grand Junction, who broke their hip and has Alzheimer's, without receiving necessary rehabilitation for their hip injury and without a suitable facility with available beds for Alzheimer's care. This situation is utterly absurd. The authorities' decision to close the facility and relocate residents to Denver, supposedly to accommodate those with mental health challenges, is equally perplexing. Our healthcare system appears to prioritize profits over compassion, and it's appalling that those with serious health issues are often treated with indifference. It's particularly egregious that emergency room patients and those with mental health challenges receive care while those with health issues are neglected. This is a disturbing state of affairs, and it's shameful that healthcare providers and politicians fail to prioritize dignity in end-of-life care."

            "It's astonishing that our healthcare system prioritizes financial gain over empathy, neglecting individuals with mental health conditions and Alzheimer's disease, often complicated by other medical issues. A recent example is the discharge of a friend from St. Mary's in Grand Junction, who suffered a hip injury and has Alzheimer's, without receiving necessary rehabilitation for their hip injury and without a suitable facility with available beds for Alzheimer's care. This situation is utterly irrational. The decision to close the facility and relocate residents to Denver, supposedly to accommodate those with mental health challenges, is equally perplexing. Our healthcare system appears to prioritize profits over compassion, and it's appalling that those with serious health issues are often treated with disregard. It's particularly egregious that emergency room patients and those with mental health challenges receive care while those with health issues are neglected. This is a disturbing state of affairs, and it's shameful that healthcare providers and politicians fail to prioritize dignity in end-of-life care, instead choosing to prioritize financial gain over human well-being."
