St. Mary's in Grand Junction just discharged a friend who broke a hip and has Alzheimer's without rehab for the hip and no place with beds open for Alzheimer's!  Ludicrous!  The \"authorities\" closed the facility to accommodate \"challenged \" residents here last year and re-located them to Denver.  Again, ridiculous!  Our health care system is without compassion and based on the bottom line!  The worst part is drug addicts, emergency room mangers of all sorts can get care but we treat those who have health issues as seniors like shit! Sad state of affairs!  Shame on healthcare and those who do not fight for dignity in end of life care!  Shameful!  Politicians should be shamed for not supporting a bill that cares for these people!",

            "It's astonishing that our healthcare system persistently falls short in providing adequate treatment and support for individuals with mental health conditions and those with Alzheimer's who also have underlying medical conditions, leading to neglect and subpar care. A stark illustration of this neglect is a friend who was discharged from St. Mary's in Grand Junction with a broken hip and Alzheimer's, only to be left without rehabilitation or access to Alzheimer's care due to a shortage of available beds, which is unacceptable. The relocation of residents with mental health conditions from a closed facility to Denver is equally alarming. Our healthcare system appears to prioritize profits over people's needs, disregarding the well-being of those with health issues and treating them as secondary. This is a deeply distressing situation, and those responsible for end-of-life care should be deeply ashamed. It's equally disheartening that politicians are failing to support legislation that prioritizes the dignity and well-being of these individuals, who deserve better care."
