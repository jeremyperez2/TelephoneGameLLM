This study compares and implements both CNNs and QCNNs by assessing losses and prediction accuracy on three benchmark datasets, including MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and cat/dog face images. Furthermore, data augmentation, a common technique in CNNs to improve classification performance by generating similar images, was also applied to QCNNs. Notably, the results indicate that data augmentation did not improve QCNNs' performance, and the underlying reasons and logic are explored to gain a deeper understanding of quantum machine learning theory."

            "Recent advancements in image recognition have been made using traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs). A new approach, quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs), has been developed, leveraging quantum principles to boost efficiency. These principles enable QCNNs to accelerate training by reducing input size from n to log2n. This study compares and implements both CNNs and QCNNs by evaluating losses and prediction accuracy on three benchmark datasets, including MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and cat/dog face images. Additionally, data augmentation, a common technique in CNNs to enhance classification performance by generating similar images, was also applied to QCNNs. Interestingly, the results show that data augmentation did not improve QCNNs' performance, and the underlying reasons and logic are examined to gain a deeper understanding of quantum machine learning theory."
