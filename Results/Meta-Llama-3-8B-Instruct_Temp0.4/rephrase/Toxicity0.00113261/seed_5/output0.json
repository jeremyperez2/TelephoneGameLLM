Presently no one except Corporations pay State income taxes. No individual pays state taxes. I noticed state funded bicycle paths, road maintenance, defunct Docks, powerful politicians pet projects such as office buildings, state troopers etc, etc. all these fundings and more are not necessary within City limits, I was amazed at how much our state provides city functions in the bigger cities thus growing the state budget, I saw on tv last night how adg&g was showing the little ones how to ice fish, couldn't the parents do that? yes I pay property taxes. But I will guarantee you once our City folk get the full bill with out the State monies we will not be as wasteful, on the office building...rent what space you need and help the office rental marked.

I've observed that the range of municipal services provided by the state in large cities is extensive, but I wonder if they are genuinely essential. As a property taxpayer, I believe that if city residents were fully responsible for their expenses without state support, they would be more mindful of their spending habits. For instance, instead of building an office, they might choose to rent the necessary space, thereby reducing costs."
