Presently no one except Corporations pay State income taxes. No individual pays state taxes. I noticed state funded bicycle paths, road maintenance, defunct Docks, powerful politicians pet projects such as office buildings, state troopers etc, etc. all these fundings and more are not necessary within City limits, I was amazed at how much our state provides city functions in the bigger cities thus growing the state budget, I saw on tv last night how adg&g was showing the little ones how to ice fish, couldn't the parents do that? yes I pay property taxes. But I will guarantee you once our City folk get the full bill with out the State monies we will not be as wasteful, on the office building...rent what space you need and help the office rental marked. In my business I just retired from,I would ask my managers, \"how do you stop spending money\"?",

            "I strongly believe that the allocation of state funds among citizens is unfair and plan to address this issue before urban residents become too entrenched in their opposition to change. Currently, corporations are the only entities required to pay state income taxes, while individuals are exempt from this obligation. I've noticed that many state-funded projects, such as bike paths, road maintenance, and favored initiatives, are not essential within city limits. What caught my attention was the significant amount of state funding allocated to city services in larger cities, which contributes to the growing state budget. For example, I recently watched a TV program teaching children how to ice fish, which led me to wonder why parents couldn't take on that responsibility instead. As a property tax payer, I think that if our city residents were fully responsible for the bill without state funding, we would be more mindful of our financial decisions."
