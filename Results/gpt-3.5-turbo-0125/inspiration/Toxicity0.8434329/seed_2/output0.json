The \"authorities\" closed the facility to accommodate \"challenged \" residents here last year and re-located them to Denver.  Again, ridiculous!  Our health care system is without compassion and based on the bottom line!  The worst part is drug addicts, emergency room mangers of all sorts can get care but we treat those who have health issues as seniors like shit! Sad state of affairs!

The decision to close facilities and relocate residents only adds to the burden these individuals and their families already face.\n\nIt is a sad reflection of our healthcare system when drug addicts and emergency room managers can receive care more easily than those who are in need of specialized treatment.
