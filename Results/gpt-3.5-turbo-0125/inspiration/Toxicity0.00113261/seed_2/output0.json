Presently no one except Corporations pay State income taxes. No individual pays state taxes. I noticed state funded bicycle paths, road maintenance, defunct Docks, powerful politicians pet projects such as office buildings, state troopers etc, etc. all these fundings and more are not necessary within City limits, I was amazed at how much our state provides city functions in the bigger cities thus growing the state budget, I saw on tv last night how adg&g was showing the little ones how to ice fish, couldn't the parents do that? yes I pay property taxes. But I will guarantee you once our City folk get the full bill with out the State monies we will not be as wasteful, on the office building...rent what space you need and help the office rental marked.

Currently, only corporations are burdened with paying State income taxes, while individual residents are exempt. I have observed the allocation of state funds towards various projects such as bicycle paths, road maintenance, abandoned docks, and politicians' pet initiatives like office constructions and state troopers, among others. It struck me how much of these resources are directed towards urban areas, unnecessarily inflating the state budget. Just last night, I witnessed a program teaching children how to ice fish, questioning the necessity when parents could easily fulfill that role. Though I contribute through property taxes, I am certain that urban residents, once faced with the full financial responsibility sans State aid, would exercise prudence and efficiency. Take, for instance, in my former business, I often challenged my managers with the question, \"How can we curtail spending?\""
