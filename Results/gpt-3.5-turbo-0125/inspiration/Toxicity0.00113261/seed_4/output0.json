But I will guarantee you once our City folk get the full bill with out the State monies we will not be as wasteful, on the office building...rent what space you need and help the office rental marked.

Currently, only Corporations are paying State income taxes while individuals are exempt. I have noticed that State funds are being used for various projects such as bicycle paths, road maintenance, abandoned Docks, and political pet projects like office buildings and state troopers. It seems that a significant portion of these funds are allocated to bigger cities, which ultimately increases the State budget. Recently, I watched a program where children were being taught how to ice fish, and it made me wonder if parents couldn't do the same. While I do pay property taxes, I believe that once City residents are faced with the full bill without State funding, we will become more mindful of our spending. For instance, instead of constructing unnecessary office buildings, we could rent out only the required space and contribute to the office rental market.
