Currently, only corporations are paying state income taxes while individuals are not. I have noticed that state funds are being used for projects like bicycle paths, road maintenance, abandoned docks, and politicians' pet projects such as office buildings and state troopers. While these projects are important, I believe they are not necessary within city limits.\n\nI was surprised to see how much the state is funding city functions in larger cities, which is causing the state budget to grow. Just last night, I watched a program where children were being taught how to ice fish by a company. Couldn't the parents do that themselves? Yes, I do pay property taxes, but I am certain that if city residents had to foot the entire bill without state funds, we would be more mindful of our spending.\n\nFor example, in my previous business, I would always ask my managers, \"how can we reduce our expenses?\" It's important to only rent the office space that is needed and not be wasteful. By doing so, we can also help stimulate the office rental market. Let's strive to be more responsible with how we use state funds and consider how we can better manage our resources."

The allocation of funds towards projects like bicycle paths and road maintenance, while important, may not be a priority within city limits.\n\nIt is concerning to see the state's growing budget due to funding city functions in larger cities. Watching children being taught how to ice fish by a company on television made me question the necessity of such programs. Shouldn't parents be the ones teaching their children such activities?\n\nWhile I do pay property taxes, I am certain that city residents would be more conscious of their spending if they had to cover the entire bill without state assistance. Just as in my previous business, where we constantly sought ways to reduce expenses, it is crucial to be mindful of how state funds are utilized.

While I recognize the importance of investing in urban infrastructure like bike paths and road maintenance, there are other pressing issues that deserve attention.\n\nOne such issue that has caught my attention is the concept of a company teaching children how to ice fish. It begs the question of whether parents are abdicating their roles in passing down traditions and skills to their children. Shouldn't it be the responsibility of families to preserve and transmit these important cultural practices?\n\nI strongly believe that if residents took more ownership of their expenditures and relied less on state aid, we would all be more mindful of how we allocate resources.
