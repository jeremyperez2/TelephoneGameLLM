            "Yan Chenglong was suspended and stripped of his title by the Chinese Xiangqi Association (CXA) for allegedly using a cheating device resembling anal beads during a competition. Despite a lack of solid evidence, the CXA decided to take disciplinary action against Yan, who had recently won the tournament. After celebrating with friends at a hotel, Yan ran into a problem with the bathtub. The CXA stated that they couldn't prove the cheating accusations, resulting in Yan losing his title and being banned from competing for one year. The association did not specify the exact amount of prize money Yan had to give up, but Xiangqi tournaments typically offer significant rewards to the champions."
