There is no evidence he intended to remain in Russia.\n\nThe Russian interior ministry informed the US embassy in Moscow on 3 May that Sgt Black had been arrested a day earlier for theft of personal property.\n\nHe is being held at a pre-trial detention facility until his next hearing.\n\n\"The Army notified his family and the US Department of State is providing appropriate consular support to the Soldier in Russia,\" the US Army said in a statement on Monday.\n\nNational Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters the US is \"aware of this case and other matters related to Russia\".\n\nAt the White House briefing on Monday, Mr Kirby said he could not provide more details.\n\nRussia is holding two other Americans. Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich has been detained since March 2023 on espionage charges.\n\nFormer US Marine Paul Whelan was accused of spying and sentenced to 16 years in prison in 2020.\n\nBoth men maintain their innocence, and the US government says the charges against them are baseless.",

            "A US Army soldier based in South Korea has been detained in Russia for a domestic crime, not related to politics or espionage. The 34-year-old soldier, who was off duty, was taken into custody on May 2 in Vladivostok while traveling from South Korea to Texas. He had traveled to Russia from China for personal reasons to visit a woman he was involved with romantically, according to US Army spokeswoman Cynthia Smith. The soldier had served in Iraq and Afghanistan before his most recent assignment in South Korea. Despite not having authorization for his trips to China and Russia, there is no evidence to suggest he planned to stay in Russia. He is currently in pre-trial detention for theft, with the US government providing consular assistance. The National Security Council is monitoring his case and others involving Americans in Russian custody, including a journalist and a former Marine, both of whom deny the charges against them."
