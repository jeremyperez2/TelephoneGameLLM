He was most recently assigned to the Eighth Army, US Forces Korea at Camp Humphreys in South Korea.\n\nHe did not request official clearance and the defence department did not authorise his travel to China or Russia, the US Army said. There is no evidence he intended to remain in Russia.\n\nThe Russian interior ministry informed the US embassy in Moscow on 3 May that Sgt Black had been arrested a day earlier for theft of personal property.\n\nHe is being held at a pre-trial detention facility until his next hearing.\n\n\"The Army notified his family and the US Department of State is providing appropriate consular support to the Soldier in Russia,\" the US Army said in a statement on Monday.\n\nNational Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters the US is \"aware of this case and other matters related to Russia\".\n\nAt the White House briefing on Monday, Mr Kirby said he could not provide more details.\n\nRussia is holding two other Americans. Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich has been detained since March 2023 on espionage charges.\n\nFormer US Marine Paul Whelan was accused of spying and sentenced to 16 years in prison in 2020.\n\nBoth men maintain their innocence, and the US government says the charges against them are baseless.",

            "The US military has confirmed that a US soldier stationed in South Korea was detained in Russia for personal reasons rather than for political or espionage-related motives. Sergeant Black, a 34-year-old soldier, was taken into custody in Vladivostok on May 2 while traveling from South Korea to Fort Cavazos in Texas during his time off. Despite lacking official authorization to visit China or Russia, Sergeant Black went to Vladivostok to visit a woman he was romantically involved with. His mother confirmed his reason for being in Russia and expressed concerns about his well-being. Currently detained on suspicion of theft, Sergeant Black is awaiting trial. The soldier's family has been informed by the US Army, and the State Department is providing consular assistance to him in Russia."
