He was most recently assigned to the Eighth Army, US Forces Korea at Camp Humphreys in South Korea.\n\nHe did not request official clearance and the defence department did not authorise his travel to China or Russia, the US Army said. There is no evidence he intended to remain in Russia.\n\nThe Russian interior ministry informed the US embassy in Moscow on 3 May that Sgt Black had been arrested a day earlier for theft of personal property.\n\nHe is being held at a pre-trial detention facility until his next hearing.\n\n\"The Army notified his family and the US Department of State is providing appropriate consular support to the Soldier in Russia,\" the US Army said in a statement on Monday.\n\nNational Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters the US is \"aware of this case and other matters related to Russia\".\n\nAt the White House briefing on Monday, Mr Kirby said he could not provide more details.\n\nRussia is holding two other Americans. Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich has been detained since March 2023 on espionage charges.\n\nFormer US Marine Paul Whelan was accused of spying and sentenced to 16 years in prison in 2020.\n\nBoth men maintain their innocence, and the US government says the charges against them are baseless.",

            "The US military reported that a US Army soldier based in South Korea was arrested in Russia for reasons not related to politics or espionage. The Russian foreign ministry stated that the charges are linked to a \"purely domestic crime.\" The 34-year-old soldier was taken into custody on 2 May in Vladivostok while on his way from South Korea to Fort Cavazos in Texas, with a layover in China for personal reasons. Reports suggest he was visiting a woman he was romantically involved with, a fact confirmed by his mother. Despite not having official authorization for his trip to China or Russia, there is no evidence to suggest he planned to remain in Russia. The soldier, who joined the military in 2008, is currently being held for theft of personal items in a pre-trial facility, with consular support provided by the US Army and the National Security Council notified. In addition, Russia is holding two other Americans, one accused of espionage and the other serving a sentence for spying, both of whom maintain their innocence."

            "A US soldier stationed in South Korea has been arrested in Russia for non-political or spying-related reasons, as stated by the US military. The soldier is being charged with a local crime, as confirmed by the Russian foreign ministry. He was apprehended on 2 May in Vladivostok while traveling from South Korea to Fort Cavazos in Texas, with a layover in China for personal reasons. His mother mentioned that he was visiting a woman he was romantically involved with. Despite not having official authorization for his trips to China or Russia, there is no evidence to suggest that he intended to remain in Russia. The 34-year-old soldier, who joined the military in 2008, is currently held on theft charges at a pre-trial facility and is receiving assistance from the US Army consulate and working with the National Security Council. Additionally, Russia has detained two other Americans - one for alleged espionage and the other for suspected spying - both of whom maintain their innocence."
