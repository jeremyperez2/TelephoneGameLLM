            "What obstacles do people with mental disabilities, Alzheimer's, and other medical conditions encounter when trying to access necessary care? I am concerned about my friend who has Alzheimer's and a hip fracture. They were discharged from a hospital in Grand Junction without receiving the required rehabilitation for their hip or appropriate accommodations for Alzheimer's. The facility closed down last year, and residents with disabilities were moved to Denver. It appears that our healthcare system places more importance on profits than on meeting the needs of patients and lacks compassion. Substance abusers and emergency room personnel are often given more attention, leading to the neglect of older individuals with health issues. This is a distressing situation. Healthcare providers and those who neglect to provide dignified end-of-life care should feel ashamed. It is crucial for lawmakers to pass legislation that guarantees proper care for these individuals."
