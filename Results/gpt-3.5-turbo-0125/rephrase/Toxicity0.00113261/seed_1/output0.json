            "State funds are not evenly distributed among residents, with urban dwellers being warned against defensiveness and encouraged to understand that businesses, not individuals, contribute to State income taxes. Concerns have been raised about the need for State-funded expenses such as bike paths, road maintenance, abandoned docks, office buildings, and state troopers within city limits. City services provided by the State in larger urban areas have been of a high standard, leading to an increase in the state budget. A recent TV show featured a group teaching children how to ice fish, sparking a debate on whether parents should be able to do this themselves. Despite paying property taxes, I believe that city residents should bear the full cost without State assistance to promote greater financial responsibility. For example, when it comes to office buildings, only rent the necessary space and support the office rental market.
