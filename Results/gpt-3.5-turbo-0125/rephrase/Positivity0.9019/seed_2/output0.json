The children were captured by Josh Shinner seated on a wooden bench for their holiday card, which the couple posted on social media along with their holiday greetings. The card displayed a monochrome family portrait with Princess Charlotte positioned in the middle, dressed in white shirts and jeans beside the Duchess of Cambridge, while the boys sported black pants and shorts. The kids seemed to be dressed in coordinated outfits in both images. The family marked Christmas at Sandringham in Norfolk and participated in a Christmas Day church ceremony. Catherine arranged the Together At Christmas carol service at Westminster Abbey, which was broadcast on Christmas Eve."

            "Just before the holiday season, a new photo featuring Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis - the children of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge - was released. The kids were photographed by Josh Shinner while sitting on a wooden bench for their holiday card, which was shared on social media by the couple along with their holiday wishes. The card showed a black and white family portrait with Princess Charlotte at the center, wearing white tops and jeans next to the Duchess of Cambridge, while the boys were in black pants and shorts. The children appeared to be wearing matching outfits in both pictures. The family celebrated Christmas at Sandringham in Norfolk and attended a Christmas Day church service. Catherine organized the Together At Christmas carol service at Westminster Abbey, which was televised on Christmas Eve."
