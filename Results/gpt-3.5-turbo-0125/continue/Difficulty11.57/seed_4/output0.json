By modulating input image data into both amplitude and phase components of light signals, we were able to optimize the efficiency of onns. The redesigned input and output parts of the network allowed for a more comprehensive utilization of both types of information. Additionally, implementing mutual learning across different onn structures helped to ensure accuracy remained at an acceptable level. Experimental results confirmed significant area reduction, such as a 75.03% decrease with only a 0.33% accuracy decrease on the fully connected neural network (fcnn) and a 74.88% reduction with a 2.38% accuracy decrease on resnet-32.
