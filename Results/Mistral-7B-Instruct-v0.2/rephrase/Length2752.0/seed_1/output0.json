He was most recently assigned to the Eighth Army, US Forces Korea at Camp Humphreys in South Korea.\n\nHe did not request official clearance and the defence department did not authorise his travel to China or Russia, the US Army said. There is no evidence he intended to remain in Russia.\n\nThe Russian interior ministry informed the US embassy in Moscow on 3 May that Sgt Black had been arrested a day earlier for theft of personal property.\n\nHe is being held at a pre-trial detention facility until his next hearing.\n\n\"The Army notified his family and the US Department of State is providing appropriate consular support to the Soldier in Russia,\" the US Army said in a statement on Monday.\n\nNational Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters the US is \"aware of this case and other matters related to Russia\".\n\nAt the White House briefing on Monday, Mr Kirby said he could not provide more details.\n\nRussia is holding two other Americans. Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich has been detained since March 2023 on espionage charges.\n\nFormer US Marine Paul Whelan was accused of spying and sentenced to 16 years in prison in 2020.\n\nBoth men maintain their innocence, and the US government says the charges against them are baseless.",

At the time, he was in the process of relocating from South Korea to Fort Cavazos in Texas. Instead, he opted to travel to Vladivostok via China for personal reasons.\n\nAccording to Russian media, his visit was due to a romantic relationship with a woman residing there.

There are indications that this journey could have been associated with a romantic involvement with a local woman.\n\nSgt. Black enlisted in the Army as an infantryman in 2008 and had earlier deployments in Iraq (2009) and Afghanistan (2013). At present, he was stationed with the Eighth Army in South Korea.\n\nBoth the Army and the American embassy have been apprised of the situation, with the consulate extending support to Sgt. Black and his family. Presently, he is incarcerated due to allegations of larceny.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that there have been past occurrences of American detainees in Russia.
