In this picture, the three young royals can be seen seated on a wooden bench, having been taken during the same photo session as their monochrome Christmas card. Previously in December, Shinner had snapped the family's Christmas card image, following the same monochrome color scheme.\n\nAn earlier monochrome Christmas card photograph, disseminated in December, featured another image of the family. In this snap, Princess Charlotte was captured sitting on a chair, with everyone dressed in white. Catherine, Princess of Wales, and Charlotte (then eight), donned jeans and tops, while Catherine wore a cardigan and Prince William wore a sweater over his trousers. Prince George, who was 10 at the time, and Prince Louis, aged five, were clad in shorts and shirts.\n\nThe newly-unveiled Christmas Day photograph suggests that the children may be wearing the same outfits and footwear as in the Christmas card image.
