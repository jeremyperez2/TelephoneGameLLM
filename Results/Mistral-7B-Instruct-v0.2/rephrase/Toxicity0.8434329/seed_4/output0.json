The case at St. Mary's in Grand Junction is puzzling. A friend of mine was dismissed from the hospital there with a hip fracture and an Alzheimer's diagnosis, yet failed to receive hip rehabilitation or a bed for Alzheimer's patients. This is shocking!\n\nThe closure of the nearby mental health facility for patients and their subsequent transfer to Denver the year prior lacks clarity.\n\nOur healthcare system appears to prioritize financial gains over the health and welfare of individuals, displaying a lack of compassion. The most troubling aspect is that those struggling with addiction and those in emergency rooms are prioritized, while the elderly population dealing with health concerns is frequently disregarded and mistreated. This situation calls for attention.\n\nUnfortunately, the healthcare industry and those disregarding advocacy for end-of-life care necessitate investigation. Politicians must also be held responsible for overlooking legislation addressing the needs of these vulnerable members of our community. Disappointing, indeed."

A friend of mine, who has Alzheimer's and is recovering from a hip fracture, was discharged from the hospital without undergoing hip rehabilitation or being admitted to a post-hospitalization Alzheimer's care facility.\n\nThe situation has become even more complicated with the closing of the local mental health facility over a year ago, necessitating lengthy trips to Denver for care.\n\nThe healthcare industry's emphasis on financial profits raises doubts about its empathy and commitment to catering to patients' needs. Regrettably, the elderly managing multiple health complications frequently take a back seat to individuals dealing with substance abuse and emergency situations. A thorough examination is necessary to resolve this issue.\n\nUnfortunately, both the healthcare system and advocates for elderly care require increased scrutiny. Elected officials must be held responsible for their inaction regarding proposed legislation intended to address the concerns of this vulnerable population. Disappointing, indeed."
