    "initial_story": "We perhaps should not be surprised that the prime minister has seized upon an extrapolation of Thursday's local election results that pointed to the prospect that the general election could result in a hung parliament in which Labour would be the largest party.\n\nSuch a scenario, he argued, would mean that Sir Keir Starmer would be \"propped up in Downing Street\" by the SNP, the Liberal Democrats, and the Greens.\n\nMany Conservative MPs (and indeed Labour ones too) believe that a poster their party ran in the 2015 election, when the polls were pointing to a hung parliament, showing the then Labour leader, Ed Miliband, in the pocket of the former SNP leader, Alex Salmond, played a key role in delivering the Conservatives a surprise overall majority.\n\nWhether or not that is what happened is not easy for analysts to say. However, British Election Study data collected at the time did not show any marked swing away from Labour among those who came to believe that Mr Miliband would be willing to do a deal with the SNP.\n\nBut, in any event, how realistic is it to use the share of the vote won by the parties in local elections to anticipate what might happen in an immediate general election? There are certainly two potential difficulties.\n\nAlthough the ups and downs in party performance in local elections often run in parallel with the rises and falls in party support in the polls, some people (around one in five) vote differently in local elections than they would in a general election.\n\nAs a result the divergence between the level of support parties win in a local election and how well they would perform in a general election has become more marked.\n\nNowadays the Liberal Democrats consistently outperform their national standing in the local ballot boxes. The same has also come to be true of the Greens, while independent candidates have also enjoyed some notable success in recent years. Labour, in contrast, often do less well in local elections.\n\nMeanwhile, the party political battle in Scotland is now very different from that in England - and the outcome of the current battle north of the border between Labour and the SNP could be crucial to the result of the next election. English local elections do not tell us much about what will happen north of the border.\n\nThese developments have made discerning the implications of local elections for the outcome of a general election more difficult.\n\nAt the same time, there are two particular features of the results of this year's local elections that make it especially difficult.\n\nFirst, the polls suggest that more people who voted Conservative in 2019 have now switched to Reform than to Labour. But Reform were only on the ballot paper in one in six council wards. So, it may well be the case that people who would vote Reform if there had been a Reform candidate locally stuck with the Tories instead.\n\nCertainly, Conservative support fell more heavily where Reform did stand. In the BBC's sample of key wards the party's support fell by 19 points in these wards - compared with 11 points in wards where Reform did not stand. Labour, in contrast, did rather better where Reform stood.\n\nThat 19-point drop matches the 19-point fall in the average level of Conservative support in the polls since May 2021. That figure may represent a better guide to the Conservatives' immediate prospects in a general election.\n\nSecond, the local election results confirm the message from last year's contests that the geography of party support has changed to the Conservatives' disadvantage.\n\nThe party's support fell more heavily in wards it was trying to defend.\n\nAt the same time, some voters seemingly voted for whichever party was best placed to defeat the Conservatives locally. Labour's support increased most (at the expense of the Liberal Democrats) in wards where they started off second to the Conservatives, while the Liberal Democrats advanced most (and Labour did less well) in wards where were the principal challengers locally.\n\nIndeed, it is these two patterns that help explain why the Conservative Party lost nearly one in two of the council seats it was trying to defend. Conservative MPs would be unwise to assume that the same fate could not also befall them.\n\nSir John Curtice is Professor of Politics, University of Strathclyde, and Senior Fellow, National Centre for Social Research and 'The UK in a Changing Europe'.

            "The prime minister's prediction of a hung parliament in the upcoming general election, with Labour as the largest party, should not come as a shock, given the local election results. This potential outcome would mean that Sir Keir Starmer would supposedly be supported in Downing Street by the SNP, Liberal Democrats, and Greens.\n\nMany Conservative and Labour MPs attribute the 2015 general election surprise result, when Ed Miliband was depicted as in the SNP's pocket in a Conservative Party poster, to the significant influence of the SNP on Labour. However, it is unclear whether this was a decisive factor.\n\nBritish Election Study data from that time did not indicate any significant shift away from Labour among those who thought Miliband might form a coalition with the SNP.\n\nHowever, relying on local election results to predict the outcome of a general election comes with challenges. Two major issues are the inconsistency between local and general election voting patterns and the changing political dynamics in Scotland.\n\nFirst, people's voting behavior in local elections may differ significantly from their choices in a general election. Around one in five voters vote differently in these two types of elections.\n\nSecond, the Liberal Democrats and Greens typically outperform their national standing in local elections, while independent candidates and Labour often underperform. Additionally, the Scottish political landscape is distinct from that of England, with Scottish local elections providing limited insight into the situation north of the border.\n\nMoreover, the 2022 local election results present two significant challenges to assessing their implications for a general election.\n\nFirst, the polls indicate that more 2019 Conservative voters have switched to Reform, but Reform was only on the ballot in one in six council wards. As a result, it is possible that voters who would have supported Reform in their local area instead voted for the Conservatives.\n\nSecond, the local election results confirm the trend from the previous contests that the geography of party support has shifted against the Conservatives. The party lost nearly half of the council seats it was defending, and voters appeared to support the party that was best positioned to defeat the Conservatives locally. Conservative MPs should be cautious about assuming they are immune to a similar fate.\n\nSir John Curtice is a Professor of Politics at the University of Strathclyde and a Senior Fellow at the National Centre for Social Research and 'The UK in a Changing Europe'.

            "The anticipated declaration of a hung parliament in the forthcoming general election, with Labour leading, should not astonish, considering local election trends. In such a scenario, Sir Keir Starmer would presumably secure support in Downing Street from the SNP, Liberal Democrats, and Greens.\n\nThe influence of the SNP on Labour during the 2015 general election, as portrayed in a Conservative Party poster depicting Ed Miliband as their pocket, has been debated among Conservative and Labour MPs. However, the extent of this impact remains uncertain.\n\nBritish Election Study data from 2015 did not suggest a significant shift away from Labour among those who believed Miliband might form a coalition with the SNP.\n\nPredicting a general election outcome based on local election results carries challenges. Two major concerns are the disparity between local and general election voting patterns and the evolving political landscape in Scotland.\n\nInitially, voters' behavior in local elections may not mirror their decisions in a general election. Approximately 20% of voters change their voting patterns between the two types of elections.\n\nFurthermore, the Liberal Democrats and Greens generally surpass their national standing in local elections, while Labour and independent candidates often underperform. Additionally, Scottish local elections offer limited insight into the political climate north of the border.\n\nMoreover, the 2022 local election outcomes pose two challenges for evaluating their implications for a general election.\n\nFirst, the polls suggest that more 2019 Conservative voters have switched to Reform, yet Reform was only a contender in one in six council wards. Consequently, it's plausible that voters who would have backed Reform in their area instead opted for the Conservatives.\n\nSecond, the local election results confirm the trend from previous contests that the geography of party support has moved against the Conservatives. The party lost almost half of the council seats it was defending, and voters predominantly supported the party most likely to defeat the Conservatives locally. Conservative MPs need to exercise caution about assuming they are shielded from a similar fate.\n\nSir John Curtice is a Professor of Politics at the University of Strathclyde and a Senior Fellow at the National Centre for Social Research and 'The UK in a Changing Europe'.
