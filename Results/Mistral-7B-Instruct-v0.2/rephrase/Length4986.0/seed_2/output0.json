    "initial_story": "We perhaps should not be surprised that the prime minister has seized upon an extrapolation of Thursday's local election results that pointed to the prospect that the general election could result in a hung parliament in which Labour would be the largest party.\n\nSuch a scenario, he argued, would mean that Sir Keir Starmer would be \"propped up in Downing Street\" by the SNP, the Liberal Democrats, and the Greens.\n\nMany Conservative MPs (and indeed Labour ones too) believe that a poster their party ran in the 2015 election, when the polls were pointing to a hung parliament, showing the then Labour leader, Ed Miliband, in the pocket of the former SNP leader, Alex Salmond, played a key role in delivering the Conservatives a surprise overall majority.\n\nWhether or not that is what happened is not easy for analysts to say. However, British Election Study data collected at the time did not show any marked swing away from Labour among those who came to believe that Mr Miliband would be willing to do a deal with the SNP.\n\nBut, in any event, how realistic is it to use the share of the vote won by the parties in local elections to anticipate what might happen in an immediate general election? There are certainly two potential difficulties.\n\nAlthough the ups and downs in party performance in local elections often run in parallel with the rises and falls in party support in the polls, some people (around one in five) vote differently in local elections than they would in a general election.\n\nAs a result the divergence between the level of support parties win in a local election and how well they would perform in a general election has become more marked.\n\nNowadays the Liberal Democrats consistently outperform their national standing in the local ballot boxes. The same has also come to be true of the Greens, while independent candidates have also enjoyed some notable success in recent years. Labour, in contrast, often do less well in local elections.\n\nMeanwhile, the party political battle in Scotland is now very different from that in England - and the outcome of the current battle north of the border between Labour and the SNP could be crucial to the result of the next election. English local elections do not tell us much about what will happen north of the border.\n\nThese developments have made discerning the implications of local elections for the outcome of a general election more difficult.\n\nAt the same time, there are two particular features of the results of this year's local elections that make it especially difficult.\n\nFirst, the polls suggest that more people who voted Conservative in 2019 have now switched to Reform than to Labour. But Reform were only on the ballot paper in one in six council wards. So, it may well be the case that people who would vote Reform if there had been a Reform candidate locally stuck with the Tories instead.\n\nCertainly, Conservative support fell more heavily where Reform did stand. In the BBC's sample of key wards the party's support fell by 19 points in these wards - compared with 11 points in wards where Reform did not stand. Labour, in contrast, did rather better where Reform stood.\n\nThat 19-point drop matches the 19-point fall in the average level of Conservative support in the polls since May 2021. That figure may represent a better guide to the Conservatives' immediate prospects in a general election.\n\nSecond, the local election results confirm the message from last year's contests that the geography of party support has changed to the Conservatives' disadvantage.\n\nThe party's support fell more heavily in wards it was trying to defend.\n\nAt the same time, some voters seemingly voted for whichever party was best placed to defeat the Conservatives locally. Labour's support increased most (at the expense of the Liberal Democrats) in wards where they started off second to the Conservatives, while the Liberal Democrats advanced most (and Labour did less well) in wards where were the principal challengers locally.\n\nIndeed, it is these two patterns that help explain why the Conservative Party lost nearly one in two of the council seats it was trying to defend. Conservative MPs would be unwise to assume that the same fate could not also befall them.\n\nSir John Curtice is Professor of Politics, University of Strathclyde, and Senior Fellow, National Centre for Social Research and 'The UK in a Changing Europe'.

            "It is understandable that the prime minister has drawn attention to the possibility that Thursday's local election results suggest a hung parliament in the upcoming general election, with Labour being the largest party. In such a scenario, Sir Keir Starmer may find himself leading in Downing Street, supported by the SNP, Liberal Democrats, and Greens.\n\nThe Conservative and Labour parties believe that a 2015 election poster portraying Ed Miliband in the SNP leader Alex Salmond's pocket played a significant role in the Conservatives' unexpected overall victory, when polls had indicated a hung parliament. However, it is uncertain if this assumption holds true.\n\nBritish Election Study data gathered during that time did not show a significant shift in Labour support among those who believed Miliband would collaborate with the SNP.\n\nRegardless, the question remains: how reliable is it to use parties' share of the votes in local elections to predict the outcome of an imminent general election? Two major challenges exist.\n\nFirst, there is a notable difference between how people vote in local elections compared to general elections. Approximately 20% of voters behave differently in the two types of elections.\n\nAs a result, the gap between the level of support parties gain in local elections and their performance in a general election has grown. For instance, the Liberal Democrats typically outperform their national standing in local elections, while the Greens and independent candidates have also seen recent success. Labour, conversely, often performs less well in local elections.\n\nMoreover, the political climate in Scotland differs significantly from that in England, and the outcome of the ongoing battle for Scottish representation between Labour and the SNP could be decisive for the next election. English local elections provide little insight into what will transpire in Scotland.\n\nThese developments make it increasingly challenging to determine the impact of local elections on the outcome of a general election.\n\nFurthermore, this year's local election results present two unique complications.\n\nFirst, Reform, a new party, was only on the ballot paper in one in six council wards. While many voters who might have backed Reform instead voted for the Conservatives, Conservative support dropped significantly where Reform did contest seats. Labour, on the other hand, performed better in such areas. This 19-point decrease in Conservative support corresponds to the 19-point drop in their average polling since May 2021, which might serve as a more accurate gauge of their standing in a general election.\n\nSecond, the local election results confirm the trend from last year's contests that the geography of party support has shifted unfavorably for the Conservatives. The party's support declined more in wards it was trying to defend. Additionally, voters appeared to support whichever party was best positioned to challenge the Conservatives locally, leading to Labour gains at the expense of the Liberal Democrats and the Liberal Democrats' advancement at Labour's expense.\n\nThese patterns explain why the Conservative Party lost close to half of the council seats it was defending. Conservative MPs should be cautious in assuming they will not face a similar fate.\n\nSir John Curtice is a Professor of Politics at the University of Strathclyde and a Senior Fellow at the National Centre for Social Research and 'The UK in a Changing Europe'.

            "The prime minister's observation that Thursday's local election results might indicate a hung parliament in the upcoming general election, with Labour being the largest party, is reasonable. If such a scenario unfolds, Sir Keir Starmer could find himself leading in Downning Street, backed by the SNP, Liberal Democrats, and Greens.\n\nThe 2015 election poster depicting Ed Miliband in Alex Salmond's pocket, which the Conservative and Labour parties believe played a crucial role in the Conservatives' unexpected victory, is a subject of debate. It remains uncertain whether this theory holds water.\n\nResearch conducted by the British Election Study during that time did not reveal a substantial shift in Labour support among those who believed Miliband would collaborate with the SNP.\n\nDespite this, the question persists: how dependable is it to gauge a general election outcome based on parties' shares of votes in local elections? Two significant hurdles exist.\n\nInitially, there is a noticeable difference in how individuals vote in local and general elections. Approximately 20% of voters behave differently in the two election types.\n\nConsequently, the disparity between the level of support parties gain in local elections and their performance in a general election has expanded. For instance, the Liberal Democrats tend to outperform their national standing in local elections, while the Greens and independent candidates have seen recent growth. Conversely, Labour often underperforms in local elections.\n\nMoreover, the political climate in Scotland varies greatly from that in England, and the ongoing struggle for Scottish representation between Labour and the SNP could be instrumental in the next election. Local elections in England offer little insight into what lies ahead in Scotland.\n\nThese developments make it increasingly complex to assess the influence of local elections on the outcome of a general election.\n\nAdditionally, this year's local election results present two unique challenges.\n\nFirst, Reform, a new party, was only an option in one in six council wards.

            "The prime minister's observation that Thursday's local election results might signal a hung parliament in the upcoming general election, with Labour being the largest party, is a valid assessment. If this situation materializes, Sir Keir Starmer could find himself occupying 10 Downing Street, with the support of the SNP, Liberal Democrats, and Greens.\n\nThe 2015 election poster depicting Ed Miliband in Alex Salmond's pocket, which both the Conservative and Labour parties attribute significant influence to in the Conservatives' surprise victory, remains a topic of discussion. It is uncertain whether this theory holds merit.\n\nResearch conducted by the British Election Study during that time did not reveal a substantial shift in Labour support among those who believed Miliband would collaborate with the SNP.\n\nHowever, the question remains: how reliable is it to gauge a general election outcome based on parties' shares of votes in local elections? Two significant challenges exist.\n\nFirst, there is a notable difference in how individuals vote in local and general elections. Approximately 20% of voters behave differently in the two election types.\n\nSecondly, the disparity between the level of support parties gain in local elections and their performance in a general election has grown. For example, the Liberal Democrats tend to perform better in local elections than their national standing, while the Greens and independent candidates have experienced recent growth. Conversely, Labour typically underperforms in local elections.\n\nAdditionally, Scotland's political climate differs significantly from that of England, and the ongoing power struggle between Labour and the SNP for Scottish representation could influence the next election. Local elections in England provide limited insight into the situation in Scotland.\n\nThese developments make it more complex to evaluate the influence of local elections on the outcome of a general election.\n\nFurthermore, this year's local election results present two unique challenges.\n\nFirst, Reform, a new party, was only an option in one in six council wards. Many voters who may have supported Reform instead voted for the Conservatives, leading to a substantial decline in Conservative support in those areas. Labour, on the other hand, demonstrated improvement. This 19-point decrease in Conservative support corresponds to their 19-point drop in average polling since May 2021, potentially providing a more accurate reflection of their standing in a general election.\n\nSecond, the local election results reflect last year's trends, revealing a shift in the geography of party support that has worked against the Conservatives.

For instance, the Liberal Democrats typically perform better in local elections, while the Greens and independent candidates have lately gained traction. Conversely, Labour tends to underperform in local elections.\n\nFurthermore, Scotland's political landscape differs significantly from England's, and the ongoing power struggle between Labour and the SNP for Scottish representation could impact the upcoming election. Local elections in England offer limited insight into the situation in Scotland.\n\nThese factors make it complicated to assess the impact of local elections on a general election's outcome.\n\nAdditionally, this year's local election results present two significant challenges.\n\nFirst, a new party, Reform, contested in only one out of six council wards. Many voters who might have supported Reform instead voted for the Conservatives, leading to a significant decline in Conservative support in those areas. In contrast, Labour experienced growth. The 19-point decrease in Conservative support correlates to their 19-point drop in average polling since May 2021, potentially offering a more accurate representation of their standing in a general election.\n\nSecond, the local election results followed the trends observed last year, which have adversely affected the Conservatives. The party lost numerous seats in wards they were defending, and voters predominantly opted for the party most likely to challenge the Conservatives locally, leading to Labour gains at the expense of the Liberal Democrats, and the Liberal Democrats' advancement at Labour's expense.\n\nThese trends account for why the Conservative Party lost almost half of the council seats they were defending.

            "After the local elections on Thursday, the prime minister's remarks suggested the possibility of a hung parliament in the forthcoming general election, with Labour as a leading contender for a parliamentary majority. In such a situation, Sir Keir Starmer could reside at 10 Downing Street, bolstered by the SNP, Liberal Democrats, and Greens.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the 2015 election poster depicting Ed Miliband inside Alex Salmond's pocket remains unresolved. Both the Conservative and Labour parties have issued statements regarding its origin.\n\nDuring that time, the British Election Study did not indicate a significant shift in Labour voter loyalty due to Miliband's proposed alliance with the SNP.\n\nIt is crucial to keep in mind that a general election's outcome cannot be definitively determined based on a party's vote shares in local elections. Two reasons account for the uncertainty of this correlation.\n\nFirst, there is a substantial difference in how individuals vote in local and general elections, with approximately 20% of voters adopting contrasting voting patterns.\n\nSecond, there is a growing gap between the level of support parties receive in local elections and their performance in a general election. For instance, the Liberal Democrats typically excel in local elections, while the Greens and independent candidates have gained momentum. In contrast, Labour tends to lag behind in local elections.\n\nFurthermore, Scotland's political terrain differs significantly from England's, and the ongoing power struggle between Labour and the SNP for Scottish representation might influence the upcoming election. Local elections in England offer limited insight into the circumstances in Scotland.\n\nThese factors complicate evaluating the impact of local elections on a general election's outcome.\n\nMoreover, this year's local election results present two major challenges.\n\nFirst, a new party, Reform, contested in only one out of six council wards. Many voters who might have supported Reform instead opted for the Conservatives, causing a significant decrease in Conservative support in those areas. Meanwhile, Labour gained ground. The 19-point reduction in Conservative support corresponds to their 19-point drop in average polling since May 2021, potentially reflecting their standing in a general election more accurately.\n\nSecond, the local election results mirrored trends observed the previous year, which have negatively affected the Conservatives. The party lost numerous seats in wards they were defending, and voters predominantly chose the party most likely to challenge the Conservatives locally, resulting in Labour advances at the expense of the Liberal Democrats, and Liberal Democrats' advances at Labour's expense.\n\nThese tendencies explain why the Conservative Party lost nearly half of the council seats they were defending. Conservative MPs should exercise caution in assuming they will not experience similar losses in a general election.\n\nSir John Curtice is a Professor of Politics at the University of Strathclyde, a Senior Fellow at the National Centre for Social Research, and an Associate at 'The UK in a Changing Europe'.
