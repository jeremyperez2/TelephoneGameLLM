    "initial_story": "We perhaps should not be surprised that the prime minister has seized upon an extrapolation of Thursday's local election results that pointed to the prospect that the general election could result in a hung parliament in which Labour would be the largest party.\n\nSuch a scenario, he argued, would mean that Sir Keir Starmer would be \"propped up in Downing Street\" by the SNP, the Liberal Democrats, and the Greens.\n\nMany Conservative MPs (and indeed Labour ones too) believe that a poster their party ran in the 2015 election, when the polls were pointing to a hung parliament, showing the then Labour leader, Ed Miliband, in the pocket of the former SNP leader, Alex Salmond, played a key role in delivering the Conservatives a surprise overall majority.\n\nWhether or not that is what happened is not easy for analysts to say. However, British Election Study data collected at the time did not show any marked swing away from Labour among those who came to believe that Mr Miliband would be willing to do a deal with the SNP.\n\nBut, in any event, how realistic is it to use the share of the vote won by the parties in local elections to anticipate what might happen in an immediate general election? There are certainly two potential difficulties.\n\nAlthough the ups and downs in party performance in local elections often run in parallel with the rises and falls in party support in the polls, some people (around one in five) vote differently in local elections than they would in a general election.\n\nAs a result the divergence between the level of support parties win in a local election and how well they would perform in a general election has become more marked.\n\nNowadays the Liberal Democrats consistently outperform their national standing in the local ballot boxes. The same has also come to be true of the Greens, while independent candidates have also enjoyed some notable success in recent years. Labour, in contrast, often do less well in local elections.\n\nMeanwhile, the party political battle in Scotland is now very different from that in England - and the outcome of the current battle north of the border between Labour and the SNP could be crucial to the result of the next election. English local elections do not tell us much about what will happen north of the border.\n\nThese developments have made discerning the implications of local elections for the outcome of a general election more difficult.\n\nAt the same time, there are two particular features of the results of this year's local elections that make it especially difficult.\n\nFirst, the polls suggest that more people who voted Conservative in 2019 have now switched to Reform than to Labour. But Reform were only on the ballot paper in one in six council wards. So, it may well be the case that people who would vote Reform if there had been a Reform candidate locally stuck with the Tories instead.\n\nCertainly, Conservative support fell more heavily where Reform did stand. In the BBC's sample of key wards the party's support fell by 19 points in these wards - compared with 11 points in wards where Reform did not stand. Labour, in contrast, did rather better where Reform stood.\n\nThat 19-point drop matches the 19-point fall in the average level of Conservative support in the polls since May 2021. That figure may represent a better guide to the Conservatives' immediate prospects in a general election.\n\nSecond, the local election results confirm the message from last year's contests that the geography of party support has changed to the Conservatives' disadvantage.\n\nThe party's support fell more heavily in wards it was trying to defend.\n\nAt the same time, some voters seemingly voted for whichever party was best placed to defeat the Conservatives locally. Labour's support increased most (at the expense of the Liberal Democrats) in wards where they started off second to the Conservatives, while the Liberal Democrats advanced most (and Labour did less well) in wards where were the principal challengers locally.\n\nIndeed, it is these two patterns that help explain why the Conservative Party lost nearly one in two of the council seats it was trying to defend. Conservative MPs would be unwise to assume that the same fate could not also befall them.\n\nSir John Curtice is Professor of Politics, University of Strathclyde, and Senior Fellow, National Centre for Social Research and 'The UK in a Changing Europe'.

In such a situation, Sir Keir Starmer would allegedly be supported by the SNP, Liberal Democrats, and Greens in Downing Street.\n\nThis prospect has been a topic of discussion among Conservative and Labour MPs, with some attributing the 2015 Conservative surprise majority to a campaign ad showing Ed Miliband in the SNP leader Alex Salmond's pocket. While it's debatable whether this ad influenced the outcome, there is evidence that voter behavior in local elections differs from that in general elections.\n\nThe British Election Study data from 2015 did not indicate a significant shift away from Labour due to concerns about a potential deal with the SNP. However, it is challenging to predict the outcome of a general election based on local election results due to several factors.\n\nFirst, the divergence between local and general election results has increased, with the Liberal Democrats and Greens frequently outperforming their national standing in local elections and independent candidates experiencing success. Labour, conversely, tends to underperform in local elections.\n\nSecond, the political landscape in Scotland differs significantly from that in England, making English local elections a poor indicator of the outcome of the Scottish battle between Labour and the SNP.\n\nMoreover, the 2021 local elections present specific challenges. Reform, a new party, only contested one in six council wards, and it appears that some voters who would have supported Reform if they had been on the ballot in their area instead voted Conservative. Additionally, the local election results confirm last year's findings that the Conservatives' geographical support has weakened, with the party losing seats in wards they were defending. These trends may serve as a warning for Conservative MPs.\n\nSir John Curtice is a Professor of Politics at the University of Strathclyde and a Senior Fellow at the National Centre for Social Research and 'The UK in a Changing Europe'.

In this circumstance, Sir Keir Starmer is said to have the support of the SNP, Liberal Democrats, and Greens in 10 Downing Street.\n\nThis situation has been a topic of discussion among Conservative and Labour parliamentarians.

Although the impact of this advertisement on the election outcome is uncertain, studies indicate that voter behavior in local elections diverges from that in general elections.\n\nAccording to the British Election Study data from 2015, there was no substantial shift from Labour due to fears of a potential arrangement with the SNP.
