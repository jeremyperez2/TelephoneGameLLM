            "Individuals dealing with musculoskeletal disorders and cognitive impairments, which restrict their mobility, may encounter unwanted psychological effects. Traditionally, diagnosing and managing these conditions demanded expensive optical motion capture systems for thorough clinical gait analysis. However, recent advancements in computer vision and deep learning technology have brought about more affordable and accessible alternatives. In this study, a new spatio-temporal transformer network is introduced, capable of extracting crucial gait data from standard RGB videos captured via a single-camera angle. Preliminary findings on a publicly accessible dataset of cerebral palsy patients suggest that this technique surpasses earlier methods and considerably enhances the evaluation of extensive gait characteristics (such as walking speed, Gait Deviation Index - GDI, and maximum knee flexion angle), independent of specifications and obviating the requirement for manual feature extraction."
