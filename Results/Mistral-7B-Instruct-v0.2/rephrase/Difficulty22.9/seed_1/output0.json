            "People with musculoskeletal disorders and cognitive impairments face challenges in moving around, resulting in both physical and emotional repercussions. Accurately evaluating gait is crucial for early diagnosis and intervention. However, the reliance on expensive optical motion capture systems limits access for numerous individuals. A recent study introduces a novel spatio-temporal transformer network capable of extracting essential gait information from regular RGB videos recorded using a solitary camera. Preliminary results on a publicly available dataset of cerebral palsy patients suggest that this technique outperforms existing methods and notably enhances the identification of significant gait features (such as walking speed, Gait Deviation Index - GDI, and maximum knee flexion angle). This approach entails fewer requirements for model preparation and obviates the need for manual feature extraction."
