However, conventional ONNs overlook the essential phase data in light, which is vital for computations, as they convert input light intensity to output light intensity. In our research, we propose an innovative solution called oplixnet to address this issue. This technique minimizes ONN zones by encoding input data into the amplitude and phase attributes of light pulses. We have redesigned the ONN input and output zones to optimally utilize amplitude and phase information. Additionally, we have implemented cross-learning between various ONN architectures to preserve precision. Based on our results, the proposed method brings about substantial ONN size reductions while retaining satisfactory accuracy levels. For instance, a fully connected neural network (FCNN) experiences a 75.03% size decrease with a minor 0.33% accuracy loss, whereas ResNet-32 achieves a 74.88% size reduction accompanied by a slight 2.38% accuracy decrease."
