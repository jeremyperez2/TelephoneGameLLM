But I will guarantee you once our City folk get the full bill with out the State monies we will not be as wasteful, on the office building...rent what space you need and help the office rental marked.

            "I've observed a significant difference in how state resources are allocated among residents, and I'd be happy to express my thoughts on this matter. Currently, only corporations are required to pay state income tax, whereas individuals are exempt. From my perspective, many state-subsidized programs, such as bike lanes, road repairs, and office buildings, primarily benefit urban populations.

In my previous business venture, I urged my team to explore cost-effective alternatives."
