            "Over the past few years, classical convolutional neural networks (C CNNs) have made substantial strides in image recognition. A promising direction for future investigation is the fusion of quantum convolutional neural networks (Q CNNs), which adhere to CNN architecture yet function according to quantum mechanics theories. Introducing quantum elements into Q CNNs could potentially quicken the learning process by compressing the dimensionality from n to 2^log(n). Within the context of our study, we assessed the strengths of CNNs and Q CNNs by examining their loss functions and accuracy on esteemed datasets: MNIST handwritten digits, Fashion MNIST, and feline/canine facial images. Similar to CNNs, we utilized data augmentation (DA) to boost CNN performance in Q CNNs. Nevertheless, our results revealed that data augmentation did not boost Q CNN performance. Consequently, we plan to explore the reasons behind this outcome and expand our comprehension of the fundamentals of quantum machine learning."
