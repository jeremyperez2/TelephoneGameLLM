            "Over the past few years, significant progress has been made in the field of image recognition using traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). More recently, a new type of CNNs known as Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs) has emerged, leveraging quantum mechanics to enhance their capabilities. Quantum mechanics accelerates the learning process in QCNNs by reducing the input dimensions from n to log2n. The primary objective of this research is to assess and compare the performance of CNNs and QCNNs using commonly-used datasets: MNIST handwritten digits, Fashion MNIST, and feline/canine face images. To improve the discriminatory power of QCNNs, standard data augmentation methods have been employed. However, the analysis of the data revealed that data augmentation did not lead to significant improvements in QCNNs' performance. This article aims to provide insight into quantum machine learning and present an engaging perspective on the rationale behind this innovative breakthrough."
