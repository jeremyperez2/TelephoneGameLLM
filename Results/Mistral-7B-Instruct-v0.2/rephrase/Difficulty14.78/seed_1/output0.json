            "Over the past few years, traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have made significant strides in image recognition. On the other hand, quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs), which utilize quantum mechanics for improved efficiency, have gained substantial attention. A key advantage of QCNNs is their capability to reduce the input size from n to log2n during training. In this research, we assess and contrast the performance of CNNs and QCNNs using the MNIST handwritten digits, Fashion MNIST, and cat/dog face image datasets. We incorporate data augmentation (DA) into QCNNs, a common optimization technique for CNNs that produces additional data from existing data. Nevertheless, our findings indicated that the implementation of DA did not boost QCNN performance. The rest of this article delves deeper into quantum machine learning, providing valuable information about the exciting advancements in this area."
