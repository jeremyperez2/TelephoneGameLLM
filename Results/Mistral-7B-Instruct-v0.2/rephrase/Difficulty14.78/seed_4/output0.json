Yet, a novel type of network, quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs), which hinge on the foundations of quantum mechanics, have come to light and surpassed the achievements of CNNs in recent groundbreaking discoveries. One perk of quantum mechanics is the compression of input dimensions from n to log2n, leading to expedited QCNN training. In the course of this exploration, we assess the attributes of CNNs and QCNNs by assessing their loss functions and prediction rates on three widely used datasets: MNIST handwritten digits, Fashion MNIST, and cat/dog facial images. Additionally, this study presents a technique known as data augmentation (DA) to QCNNs, a technique frequently employed by CNNs to enhance classification accuracy by creating new images from existing data. Nevertheless, our trials showed that data augmentation did not enhance QCNN performance. This work sheds light on the rationale behind this outcome and pushes the boundaries of quantum machine learning."
