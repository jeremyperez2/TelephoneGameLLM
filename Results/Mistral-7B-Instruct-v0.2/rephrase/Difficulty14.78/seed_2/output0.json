            "Over the last several years, traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved notable progress in the domain of image recognition. More recently, a new category of CNNs referred to as quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) has emerged. QCNNs incorporate quantum components to expedite training through a reduction in dimensionality from n to log2n. The goal of this study is to evaluate and compare the performance of CNNs and QCNNs, utilizing loss functions and prediction accuracy. This evaluation will take place using the MNIST handwritten digits, Fashion MNIST, and cat/dog face images datasets. To support QCNNs, data augmentation (DA) was adopted as a strategy. However, the results indicated that DA did not bring about a substantial improvement in QCNNs' performance. The intention of this study is to expand our knowledge in the field of quantum machine learning by examining the factors contributing to this observation."

            "In the field of image recognition over the past few years, conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have made significant strides. Lately, a new subclass of CNNs known as quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) has come to light. QCNNs integrate quantum elements to speed up training by diminishing the dimensionality from n to log2n. The objective of this research is to assess and contrast the performance of CNNs and QCNNs through the application of loss functions and prediction accuracy. This assessment will transpire using the MNIST handwritten digits, Fashion MNIST, and cat/dog face images datasets. In order to fortify QCNNs, data augmentation (DA) was employed as a tactic. Nevertheless, the findings suggested that DA did not lead to a considerable enhancement in QCNNs' performance. The purpose of this study is to broaden our understanding in the realm of quantum machine learning by scrutinizing the reasons behind this observation."
