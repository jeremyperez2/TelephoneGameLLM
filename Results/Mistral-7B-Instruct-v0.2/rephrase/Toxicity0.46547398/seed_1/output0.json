The allegations of dishonesty you have levied against me are disconcerting, given the recurring inaccuracies and dismissal of opposing viewpoints.\n\nUnjustified criticisms of my military background were unfounded. Previously, you have cast aspersions on my military background, insinuating, \"Those who frequently bring up their 'Vietnam war veteran' status may have spent more time in brothels than on battlefields,\" and \"Given your command of two marine infantry battalions in Vietnam, how much M-16 ammunition did each soldier carry daily during reconnaissance missions?\" Such remarks undermine the worth of a trustworthy companion.\n\nOur relationship has deteriorated, and I no longer view you as a friend. Your lack of evidence, unwarranted attacks, and inconsistency are evident. My sentiments toward you are decidedly unfavorable."

The accusations of dishonesty you have hurled at me are unsettling, given the frequent inaccuracies and rejection of contrary arguments.\n\nBaseless criticisms of my military history were unwarranted. In the past, you have questioned my military background, implying, \"Individuals who frequently mention their 'Vietnam war veteran' status may have spent more time in brothels than on battlefields,\" and \"Considering your command of two marine infantry battalions in Vietnam, how much M-16 ammunition did each soldier carry daily during reconnaissance missions?\" Such comments undermine the value of a dependable ally.\n\nOur bond has weakened, and I no longer consider you a friend. Your absence of proof, baseless assaults, and inconsistency are palpable. My feelings towards you are far from positive."
