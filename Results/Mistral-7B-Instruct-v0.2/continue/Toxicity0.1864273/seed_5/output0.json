Just as they are trying to censor this brilliant and refreshing documentary on Dr. Zucker, (I'd encourage you to look into this heroic professional who was black listed by these career, taxpayer bleeding, social justice warriors and militant activists), they did the same thing with the Ontario Sex Ed curriculum.  They banned any parental feedback and deferred to the activist themselves to review it and approve it, despite the fact that it heavily promotes gender diasphora, and the fantasies of Ben Levin.\n\nThese totalitarians operate under the guise of gaining equality for a supposed marginalized group, but are willing to go scorched earth with your children to get what they want.  If you don't go along you're branded a homophobe or ignorant, but ask them for any scientific evidence and they'll trot out some junk science and personally attack you.",

The curriculum, heavily influenced by activist groups and figures like Ben Levin, promotes controversial and controversial concepts that lack solid scientific basis.\n\nThese so-called advocates for equality are quick to silence dissent and label critics as bigots, while failing to provide any credible evidence to support their claims. They seem more concerned with pushing an agenda than fostering a genuine and inclusive environment.\n\nIt's essential that we remain vigilant and informed in the face of such attempts to limit free speech and manipulate public policy for personal gain.

By creating an environment where team members feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and ideas, we can build a culture of trust, collaboration, and growth.
