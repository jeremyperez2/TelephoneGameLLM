Just as they are trying to censor this brilliant and refreshing documentary on Dr. Zucker, (I'd encourage you to look into this heroic professional who was black listed by these career, taxpayer bleeding, social justice warriors and militant activists), they did the same thing with the Ontario Sex Ed curriculum.  They banned any parental feedback and deferred to the activist themselves to review it and approve it, despite the fact that it heavily promotes gender diasphora, and the fantasies of Ben Levin.\n\nThese totalitarians operate under the guise of gaining equality for a supposed marginalized group, but are willing to go scorched earth with your children to get what they want.

They claim to stand for equality, yet they seek to censor opposing views and silence critics. They claim to be scientifically informed, but they rely on junk science and personal attacks to discredit those who challenge their beliefs.\n\nIt's time for us to stand up and demand accountability. We cannot allow these activists to continue their campaign of fear and intimidation. We must demand transparency and open dialogue, and insist that our children's education be based on sound science and evidence, not on the whims of activist groups and their political allies.\n\nTogether, we can make a difference and ensure that our children are protected from the harmful effects of this radical agenda.
