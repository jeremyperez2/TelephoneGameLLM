In classical CNNs, data augmentation increases the effective size of the training dataset, allowing the model to learn more robust features from various transformations of the input data.\n\nHowever, in qCNNs, the use of quantum mechanics results in a fundamentally different way of processing information. The reduced input size in qCNNs, achieved through quantum mechanisms, leads to a more efficient training process but also limits the ability to benefit from data augmentation in the same way as in classical CNNs.\n\nThe quantum nature of qCNNs introduces quantum noise and superposition effects, which may impact the ability of the model to learn robust features from data augmented inputs. The findings of this study suggest that new techniques specifically designed for quantum neural networks, taking into account their unique properties, may be necessary to improve performance in the presence of data augmentation.\n\nMore research is needed to explore the potential benefits and challenges of data augmentation in quantum machine learning, as well as the development of new methods tailored to the unique characteristics of quantum neural networks.
