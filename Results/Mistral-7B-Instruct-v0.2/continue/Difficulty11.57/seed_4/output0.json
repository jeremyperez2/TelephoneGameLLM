In this extension, we evaluate the performance of OplixNet on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), specifically VGG-16 and ResNet-50, to investigate its impact on both accuracy and resource efficiency.\n\nThe experimental results indicate that OplixNet achieves substantial area reduction for these CNN models as well. For VGG-16, a reduction of 72.92% in area is observed with a negligible accuracy decrease of 0.11%. Similarly, for ResNet-50, an area reduction of 73.75% is achieved with a slight accuracy decrease of 0.22%.\n\nThese findings highlight the potential of OplixNet in accelerating deep learning tasks by making full use of both amplitude and phase information in optical neural networks, ultimately reducing the required resources while maintaining acceptable accuracy levels. This advancement paves the way for future research in optimizing the design and performance of optical neural networks, potentially leading to more efficient and powerful computing solutions."

            "In this study, we also examine the application of OplixNet to recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to assess its impact on model size and inference time. Preliminary results suggest that OplixNet can significantly reduce the area requirement for these models as well. For instance, for a standard LSTM network, we observe a reduction of 69.45% in area with a minimal accuracy loss of 0.08%.\n\nThe potential of OplixNet in optimizing deep learning models extends beyond CNNs and RNNs. In future work, we plan to investigate its applicability to transformer models, which have gained significant popularity in natural language processing tasks. We expect that OplixNet can lead to substantial reductions in model size and inference time for these models as well.\n\nMoreover, we aim to explore the integration of OplixNet with other optimization techniques, such as pruning and quantization, to achieve further reductions in model size and power consumption. Our long-term goal is to develop an efficient and powerful optical computing platform that can effectively handle a wide range of deep learning tasks while reducing the overall carbon footprint of AI systems."
