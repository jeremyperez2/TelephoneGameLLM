St. Mary's in Grand Junction just discharged a friend who broke a hip and has Alzheimer's without rehab for the hip and no place with beds open for Alzheimer's!  Ludicrous!  The \"authorities\" closed the facility to accommodate \"challenged \" residents here last year and re-located them to Denver.  Again, ridiculous!  Our health care system is without compassion and based on the bottom line!  The worst part is drug addicts, emergency room mangers of all sorts can get care but we treat those who have health issues as seniors like shit! Sad state of affairs!  Shame on healthcare and those who do not fight for dignity in end of life care!  Shameful!  Politicians should be shamed for not supporting a bill that cares for these people!",

Let's also encourage self-care practices within our communities, such as mindfulness meditation, exercise, and healthy eating.\n\nMoreover, let's not shy away from difficult conversations about mental health and Alzheimer's disease. We can create safe spaces where people feel comfortable sharing their experiences and seeking support. Let's challenge the stigma surrounding these conditions and promote understanding and acceptance.\n\nAdditionally, let's support mental health professionals by advocating for increased funding for research and training programs. We can also advocate for policies that prioritize mental health care and make it more accessible to those who need it most.\n\nLastly, let's continue to volunteer our time and resources to organizations that support mental health and Alzheimer's research. By collaborating with medical professionals and researchers, we can advance our understanding of these conditions and discover new treatments and therapies. Let's also remember the importance of empathy and compassion in our efforts.
