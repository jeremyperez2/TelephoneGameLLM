St. Mary's in Grand Junction just discharged a friend who broke a hip and has Alzheimer's without rehab for the hip and no place with beds open for Alzheimer's!  Ludicrous!  The \"authorities\" closed the facility to accommodate \"challenged \" residents here last year and re-located them to Denver.  Again, ridiculous!  Our health care system is without compassion and based on the bottom line!  The worst part is drug addicts, emergency room mangers of all sorts can get care but we treat those who have health issues as seniors like shit! Sad state of affairs!

This lack of compassion and prioritization based on the bottom line is indeed a sad state of affairs.\n\nWe need to come together as a society and demand better for our elderly and vulnerable populations. Let us not forget that every individual deserves dignity and respect, regardless of their circumstances. It's time for our politicians to support and pass bills that prioritize end-of-life care for all, especially those who are most in need.\n\nLet us keep fighting for the rights and well-being of those who are struggling to receive the care they deserve.
