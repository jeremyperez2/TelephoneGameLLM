Now, a groundbreaking development has emerged in the form of Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs). QCNNs represent an innovative advancement over CNNs, as they incorporate quantum mechanisms to enhance their functionality. These quantum mechanisms streamline the training process in QCNNs by drastically reducing the input size from $n$ to $log\\_2n$.\n\nIn this study, we delve into the implementation and comparison of both CNNs and QCNNs. To test their prowess, we assessed losses and prediction accuracy on three widely adopted datasets: the MNIST hand-written digits, Fashion MNIST, and cat/dog face images. Data augmentation (DA), a popular technique in CNNs to bolster classification performance by generating similar images based on original inputs, was also integrated into QCNNs.\n\nThe results were unexpected. While DA significantly improved CNNs' performance, it failed to provide the same boost in QCNNs. This intriguing finding prompts us to explore the underlying reasons and logic.
