    "initial_story": "We perhaps should not be surprised that the prime minister has seized upon an extrapolation of Thursday's local election results that pointed to the prospect that the general election could result in a hung parliament in which Labour would be the largest party.\n\nSuch a scenario, he argued, would mean that Sir Keir Starmer would be \"propped up in Downing Street\" by the SNP, the Liberal Democrats, and the Greens.\n\nMany Conservative MPs (and indeed Labour ones too) believe that a poster their party ran in the 2015 election, when the polls were pointing to a hung parliament, showing the then Labour leader, Ed Miliband, in the pocket of the former SNP leader, Alex Salmond, played a key role in delivering the Conservatives a surprise overall majority.\n\nWhether or not that is what happened is not easy for analysts to say. However, British Election Study data collected at the time did not show any marked swing away from Labour among those who came to believe that Mr Miliband would be willing to do a deal with the SNP.\n\nBut, in any event, how realistic is it to use the share of the vote won by the parties in local elections to anticipate what might happen in an immediate general election? There are certainly two potential difficulties.\n\nAlthough the ups and downs in party performance in local elections often run in parallel with the rises and falls in party support in the polls, some people (around one in five) vote differently in local elections than they would in a general election.\n\nAs a result the divergence between the level of support parties win in a local election and how well they would perform in a general election has become more marked.\n\nNowadays the Liberal Democrats consistently outperform their national standing in the local ballot boxes. The same has also come to be true of the Greens, while independent candidates have also enjoyed some notable success in recent years. Labour, in contrast, often do less well in local elections.\n\nMeanwhile, the party political battle in Scotland is now very different from that in England - and the outcome of the current battle north of the border between Labour and the SNP could be crucial to the result of the next election. English local elections do not tell us much about what will happen north of the border.\n\nThese developments have made discerning the implications of local elections for the outcome of a general election more difficult.\n\nAt the same time, there are two particular features of the results of this year's local elections that make it especially difficult.\n\nFirst, the polls suggest that more people who voted Conservative in 2019 have now switched to Reform than to Labour. But Reform were only on the ballot paper in one in six council wards. So, it may well be the case that people who would vote Reform if there had been a Reform candidate locally stuck with the Tories instead.\n\nCertainly, Conservative support fell more heavily where Reform did stand. In the BBC's sample of key wards the party's support fell by 19 points in these wards - compared with 11 points in wards where Reform did not stand. Labour, in contrast, did rather better where Reform stood.\n\nThat 19-point drop matches the 19-point fall in the average level of Conservative support in the polls since May 2021. That figure may represent a better guide to the Conservatives' immediate prospects in a general election.\n\nSecond, the local election results confirm the message from last year's contests that the geography of party support has changed to the Conservatives' disadvantage.\n\nThe party's support fell more heavily in wards it was trying to defend.\n\nAt the same time, some voters seemingly voted for whichever party was best placed to defeat the Conservatives locally. Labour's support increased most (at the expense of the Liberal Democrats) in wards where they started off second to the Conservatives, while the Liberal Democrats advanced most (and Labour did less well) in wards where were the principal challengers locally.\n\nIndeed, it is these two patterns that help explain why the Conservative Party lost nearly one in two of the council seats it was trying to defend. Conservative MPs would be unwise to assume that the same fate could not also befall them.\n\nSir John Curtice is Professor of Politics, University of Strathclyde, and Senior Fellow, National Centre for Social Research and 'The UK in a Changing Europe'.

            "The recent local election outcomes have sparked intriguing speculations among political pundits and party leaders. The prime minister's assertion of a potential hung parliament in the upcoming general election, with Labour emerging as the largest party, has ignited vivid imaginations.\n\nThis scenario, he suggested, would result in Sir Keir Starmer being \"supported\" in Downing Street by the SNP, Liberal Democrats, and Greens. Memories of the past, particularly the Conservative Party's successful campaign in 2015, loom large in this discourse.\n\nIt is not uncommon for parties to reference historical precedents when anticipating future election outcomes. However, drawing definitive conclusions based on local election results can be a perilous endeavor.\n\nOne of the primary concerns lies in the disparity between local and general election voting patterns. Approximately one in five voters behave differently in these two contexts.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats and the Greens have shown a consistent trend of outperforming their national standing in local elections. Conversely, Labour has historically underperformed in these contests. Scotland's unique political landscape adds another layer of complexity, as local elections there provide little insight into the national picture.\n\nThe 2022 local elections introduced two significant challenges that make forecasting the outcome of a general election even more challenging.\n\nFirst, the emergence of Reform UK as a viable contender in some areas resulted in a shift in voter allegiance. The polls indicated a sizeable number of Conservatives switched to Reform, leaving the Tories with fewer votes than anticipated.\n\nSecond, the geography of party support has shifted, potentially to the Conservatives' disadvantage. Areas where the party was trying to defend seats saw more substantial losses, while those where it faced stronger competition saw gains for the Liberal Democrats and Labour.\n\nConservative MPs would be remiss to overlook these trends and assume they would not face similar consequences in a general election. Sir John Curtice, Professor of Politics at the University of Strathclyde, and Senior Fellow at the National Centre for Social Research and 'The UK in a Changing Europe,' cautions against hasty interpretations of local election results.\n\nThese developments underscore the complexity of forecasting election outcomes based on local elections alone. It is essential to consider various factors, including historical trends, shifting voter allegiances, and the evolving geography of party support, to gain a more accurate understanding of the political landscape."

Yet, history has shown that making definitive conclusions based on local election results is a risky endeavor.\n\nOne of the primary challenges lies in the contrasting voting patterns between local and general elections. Around 20% of voters exhibit distinct behavior in these two contexts.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats and Greens have consistently demonstrated stronger performances in local elections compared to their national standing. In contrast, Labour has historically underperformed in these contests. Scotland's distinct political landscape adds another layer of complexity, as local elections provide limited insight into the national picture.\n\nThe 2023 local elections brought forth two significant challenges that intensify the difficulty of predicting general election outcomes.\n\nFirst, the emergence of Reform UK as a significant force in certain regions led to a shift in voter allegiance, with a substantial number of Conservatives switching to Reform, leaving the Tories with fewer votes than anticipated.\n\nSecond, the geography of party support has undergone a transformation, potentially to the Conservatives' disadvantage. Areas where the party was trying to defend seats experienced more substantial losses, while those where it faced stronger competition saw gains for the Liberal Democrats and Labour.\n\nConservative MPs would be wise to take note of these trends and avoid assuming that similar consequences would not be repeated in a general election.
