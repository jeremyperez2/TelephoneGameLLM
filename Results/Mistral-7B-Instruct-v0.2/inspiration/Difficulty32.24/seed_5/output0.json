Overview of Multilingual and Plurilingual Digital Lexicographical Resources:\nThis section provides an extensive description of various digital lexicographical resources, including multilingual dictionaries, databases, thesauri, and portals.\n\n2. Typological Proposals for Multilingual and Plurilingual Digital Lexicographical Resources:\nWe present several typological parameters to define and demarcate specific electronic resources, such as multilingual dictionaries and portals. These parameters include:\n- Multilingual vs. Plurilingual: Resources that focus on translations between two languages versus resources that cater to multiple languages and dialects.\n- Dynamic vs. Static: Resources that offer real-time information and updates versus resources with fixed content.\n- Interactive vs. Non-interactive: Resources that allow user contributions and feedback versus resources that only provide precompiled data.\n\n3. Prototypical Degree of Multilingual and Plurilingual Digital Lexicographical Resources:\nThis part discusses the concept of prototypical degree, which refers to the degree to which a resource embodies the essential characteristics of its category. We analyze various resources and classify them based on their prototypical degree.\n\n4. Object of Study in Multilingual and Plurilingual Lexicography:\nThis section critically examines the scope of the field of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography, questioning the boundaries of what constitutes a 'resource' and what role different types of resources play in linguistic research and language teaching.\n\nConclusion:\nThis paper concludes by providing a taxonomic framework for understanding and categorizing multilingual and plurilingual digital lexicographical resources, paving the way for further research and exploration in this evolving field."
