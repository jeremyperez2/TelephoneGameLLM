Our objective is twofold: firstly, to establish a set of quantitative and qualitative criteria for evaluating and categorizing lexicographical tools, such as dictionaries, differently than platforms and websites. Secondly, to distinguish multilingual and plurilingual resources based on their prototypical features.\n\nThe paper begins with an in-depth analysis of various multilingual and plurilingual digital lexical resources. We examine their unique characteristics, functionalities, and user interfaces to develop a thorough understanding of each.\n\nAdditionally, we propose several key parameters and typological definitions to distinguish multilingual dictionaries and portals. These parameters include the scope of languages covered, the type of linguistic data provided, and the level of user interactivity.\n\nFurthermore, we question the boundaries of multilingual and plurilingual lexography and discuss the implications of the digital age on the field. By critically examining the evolution of these resources and their potential impact, we contribute to the ongoing discourse on the role of digital lexical tools in multilingual and plurilingual contexts."
