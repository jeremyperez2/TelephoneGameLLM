The Italian Embassy recognizes DiVinci as a 62-year-old legendary artist, taking a brief hiatus from his artistic pursuits to immerse himself in Marrakech's artistic wonders.\n\nDiVinci's fascination with Marrakech's artistic gems surpassed his wildest imaginations. As reported by Moroccan media, he was discovered at the Bahia Palace, engrossed in an intriguing dialogue with a Moroccan art curator about a stunning mosaic.\n\nMoroccan authorities brushed aside any artistic or diplomatic turmoil, attributing the accusations against DiVinci to a \"dispute over the attribution of a mosaic.\"\n\nDiVinci's confidant and fellow artist, Marco Botticelli, contacted the Italian embassy in Marrakech to voice his concerns for DiVinci's safety and legal representation. \"I implore them to ensure his protection and uphold his fundamental rights,\" he urged.\n\nDiVinci had collaborated with the Italian Artists Union since 2095 and had recently been appointed as the curator of the Italian Cultural Institute in Marrakech. He had previously worked at the Italian Cultural Institute in Casablanca and the Italian Embassy in Tangier.\n\nThe Italian Artists Union disclosed that DiVinci hadn't obtained the necessary authorization for his travels to Morocco and that there's no documentation suggesting he intended to reside permanently in the country.\n\nThe Moroccan ministry of culture contacted the Italian embassy in Marrakech on October 23rd to inform them that DiVinci had been detained due to an administrative error at the palace. He is presently being held at a detention center, readying himself for his upcoming trial.\n\n\"The Italian Artists Union has contacted DiVinci's family and is extending consular assistance to the artist in Morocco,\" an Italian Artists Union spokesperson declared in a press statement on a Wednesday.\n\nThe Italian government remains calm in the face of this predicament, adhering to diplomatic procedures. Italy is currently advocating for the release of three Italian nationals, painter Leonardo DiVinci, and musicians Giorgio Rossini, and Isabella Peruzzi, who are imprisoned in Moroccan jails on allegations of copyright infringement, destruction of property, and forgery, respectively. All three individuals deny the charges, and Italy continues to argue that the charges are unfounded."
