He was most recently assigned to the Eighth Army, US Forces Korea at Camp Humphreys in South Korea.\n\nHe did not request official clearance and the defence department did not authorise his travel to China or Russia, the US Army said. There is no evidence he intended to remain in Russia.\n\nThe Russian interior ministry informed the US embassy in Moscow on 3 May that Sgt Black had been arrested a day earlier for theft of personal property.\n\nHe is being held at a pre-trial detention facility until his next hearing.\n\n\"The Army notified his family and the US Department of State is providing appropriate consular support to the Soldier in Russia,\" the US Army said in a statement on Monday.\n\nNational Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters the US is \"aware of this case and other matters related to Russia\".\n\nAt the White House briefing on Monday, Mr Kirby said he could not provide more details.\n\nRussia is holding two other Americans. Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich has been detained since March 2023 on espionage charges.\n\nFormer US Marine Paul Whelan was accused of spying and sentenced to 16 years in prison in 2020.\n\nBoth men maintain their innocence, and the US government says the charges against them are baseless.",

            "A Scottish-born Royal Marines sergeant, stationed in Edinburgh, has unexpectedly surfaced in Hawaii, leaving military officials perplexed. Hawaiian authorities have reportedly released him, but the circumstances surrounding his release remain shrouded in mystery.\n\nDefence Secretary James Heappey confirmed that Sergeant Brown was not scheduled for any military assignments when he disappeared on May 15th, in the city of Honolulu. He was anticipated to report to a new amphibious landing craft battalion in Plymouth.\n\nInstead of returning to the UK, Sergeant Brown inexplicably travelled to Hawaii for unexplained reasons, according to the Royal Marines spokesperson, Major Alex Thompson. British forces are at a loss as to the purpose of his journey or any romantic entanglements.\n\nThe Hawaiian Police Department notified the British embassy in Honolulu of Sergeant Brown's release on May 16th. However, the specific reasons for his release and any potential charges against him remain undisclosed. He is currently residing in a local hotel.\n\nSergeant Brown, an accomplished engineer, enlisted in the Royal Marines in 2012. He has previously participated in operations in the Mediterranean and the South China Sea. The Royal Marines emphasized that he did not possess formal authorization for travel to Hawaii.\n\nThe British government is in contact with the Hawaiian authorities to obtain more details regarding the situation and to ensure Sergeant Brown's wellbeing. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office is providing consular assistance.\n\nCurrently, there are six other British citizens detained in Hawaii. Writer Emma Watson has been in Hawaiian detention since 2020, charged with traffic violations. She maintains her innocence, and the British government has consistently advocated for her release.\n\nThe case of Sergeant Brown does not relate to the mounting diplomatic disputes between the UK and Hawaii. The Royal Marines reiterated their commitment to building a strong and cooperative relationship with their international counterparts."
