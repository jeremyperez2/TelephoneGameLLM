These issues not only hamper physical mobility but also negatively impact psychological well-being. Early detection and intervention are crucial to mitigate the progression of these conditions. Traditionally, clinical gait analysis, an essential diagnostic tool, has relied on high-priced optical motion capture systems. However, recent advancements in computer vision and deep learning provide more accessible and economical alternatives.\n\nThis study introduces an innovative spatial-temporal transformer network, capable of estimating vital gait parameters from RGB videos captured using a standard single-view camera. Our proposed framework demonstrates substantial improvements in predicting fundamental gait characteristics (such as walking speed, gait deviation index - GDI, and knee flexion angle at maximum extension) on a publicly available dataset of patients with Huntington's disease, surpassing existing state-of-the-art approaches. By utilizing fewer parameters and eliminating the requirement for manual feature extraction, our method offers a more streamlined and cost-effective solution for clinical gait analysis."
