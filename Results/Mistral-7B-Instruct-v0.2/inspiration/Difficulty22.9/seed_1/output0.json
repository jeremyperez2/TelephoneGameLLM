Precise evaluation of these conditions is crucial for timely intervention and effective treatment. Conventional gait analysis methods, which focus on assessing movement patterns and identifying cognitive impairments, have largely depended on elaborate and pricey optical motion capture systems. However, the latest breakthroughs in computer vision and deep learning technologies offer promising alternatives. In this study, we present a novel spatiotemporal transformer network to extract vital gait parameters from simple RGB videos taken by a single-view camera. Preliminary tests on a publicly available dataset of Parkinson's disease patients demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms existing methods and exhibits substantial improvements in predicting essential gait metrics (such as walking pace, gait symmetry index - GSI, and hip flexion angle at maximum extension), all while requiring fewer computational resources and eliminating the requirement for manual feature extraction."
