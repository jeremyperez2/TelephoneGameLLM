But I will guarantee you once our City folk get the full bill with out the State monies we will not be as wasteful, on the office building...rent what space you need and help the office rental marked.

Currently, only corporations shoulder the burden of state income taxes, while individuals are exempt. I've observed state investments in projects such as bicycle paths, road maintenance, and even defunct docks. Powerful politicians' pet projects like office buildings and state troopers are also funded. These expenditures, among others, are not essential within city limits, yet they significantly contribute to the state budget.\n\nLast night, I watched a TV program showing kids learning how to ice fish, and I wondered, couldn't their parents teach them? Perhaps it's time for cities to bear more responsibility and rely less on state funds. Property taxes pay for some of the city services, but if we were to shoulder the full cost without state monies, we would become more mindful of our spending.\n\nFor instance, in my retired business, I would ask my managers, \"how can we reduce expenses?\" Similarly, cities can rent only the necessary office space and contribute to the rental market. By reevaluating our reliance on state funds, we can make more efficient use of our resources and promote fiscal responsibility."

Presently, large corporations carry the weight of state taxes, while individuals are free from this burden.\n\nThe other day, I came across a local news article about a farming cooperative seeking funding for a new irrigation system. Their request for state assistance was denied, but I couldn't help but think, why not invest in our rural communities instead?\n\nI've witnessed state expenditures on projects like high-speed railways and urban renewal projects. While these initiatives have their merits, they don't necessarily provide immediate solutions for our rural counterparts. Instead, I suggest shifting the focus towards essential projects that benefit all areas, such as improved broadband infrastructure and rural healthcare.\n\nLast night, I watched a heartwarming documentary about a rural community coming together to build a new community center. Their determination and resourcefulness were inspiring. If we were to empower our rural areas to be more self-sufficient, they could thrive without relying heavily on state funds.\n\nIn my former business, I frequently encouraged my team to find ways to cut costs.
