Traditional ONNs manipulate light amplitudes at the input and detect them at the output. However, the largely unexplored phase information of light waves holds valuable computational data. In this study, we present a novel framework named PhasixNet to optimize ONN layouts by encoding input data into both the amplitudes and phases of light signals. We have redesigned the ONN input and output components to fully harness the capabilities of amplitude and phase data. Furthermore, we have incorporated inter-ONN learning to preserve precision. Our findings reveal that PhasixNet markedly diminishes ONN sizes while maintaining acceptable accuracy. For instance, a 75.1% reduction in area is achieved with a mere 0.32% decrease in accuracy for a fully connected neural network (FCNN), and a 74.9% reduction in area results in a 2.4% accuracy decrease for ResNet-32."
