HNNs have recently emerged as promising candidates for accelerating machine learning tasks.

The unexplored potential of employing light phases as carriers of data for computation has been largely neglected in existing designs.

Additionally, we integrate cross-learning among diverse HNN structures to uphold precision. Our tests reveal that HoloPhaseNet substantially reduces HNN sizes while preserving satisfactory accuracy levels. For instance, a 72.34% reduction in size is attained with a negligible 0.08% decrease in accuracy for dense neural networks (DNNs), and a 72.89% reduction in size is obtained with a 3.17% accuracy decrease for Inception-v3."

The untapped potential of utilizing light phases as data conveyors for computation has been largely disregarded in current designs. In response to this lacuna, we put forth a pioneering architecture titled PhaseShiftNet. This design condenses PNNs by encoding input data into both amplitude and phase components of light waves coursing through the PNNs. We revamp the input and output interfaces of PNNs to fully leverage the synergy of amplitude and phase data. Furthermore, we introduce cross-learning among assorted PNN structures to maintain precision. Our trials demonstrate that PhaseShiftNet significantly diminishes PNN sizes while maintaining satisfactory accuracy thresholds. For instance, a reduction of 74.12% in size is realized with a negligible 0.02% drop in accuracy for convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and a reduction of 76.21% in size is achieved with a 1.23% accuracy decrease for Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)."

We redesign the input and output interfaces of PSNs to maximally utilize the harmonious combination of amplitude and phase data. Moreover, we incorporate cross-learning among various PSN configurations to maintain precision. Our findings indicate that PhasePSN drastically reduces PSN sizes while maintaining satisfactory accuracy thresholds. For instance, a 85.71% decrease in size is attained with a marginal 0.01% drop in accuracy for 3D-Convolutional Neural Networks, and a 88.12% reduction in size is accomplished with a 1.9% accuracy decrease for 3D-Recurrent Neural Networks."
