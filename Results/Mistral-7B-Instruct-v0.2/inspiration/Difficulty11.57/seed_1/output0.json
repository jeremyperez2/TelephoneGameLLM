Traditional ONNs modify light amplitudes at their inputs and detect them at their outputs. However, the significance of the light phases, which can carry valuable computing data, has been overlooked in conventional architectures.\n\nTo rectify this limitation, this research introduces a novel framework named OpLixNet, designed to compress the ONNs by encoding input data into both the amplitude and phase parts of light signals. The input and output components of the ONNs are reengineered to maximize the utility of both amplitude and phase information. Furthermore, we introduce mutual learning among different ONN structures to preserve accuracy.\n\nExperimental findings illustrate that OpLixNet effectively minimizes ONN areas while maintaining acceptable accuracy levels. For example, a 75.11% reduction in area is achieved with a mere 0.28% accuracy decrease for a fully connected neural network (FCNN), and a 74.95% reduction in area is accomplished with a 2.12% accuracy decrease for ResNet-32."
