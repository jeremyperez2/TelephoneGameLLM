They impede progress, mercilessly silencing trailblazers on the brink of revolutionary discoveries, echoing the tragic end of Leonardo da Vinci.\n\nInfiltrating the sacred halls of academia, they disseminate falsehoods, camouflaging their deception under the mantle of knowledge. This skewed prism, crafted from the brilliance of minds like Albert Einstein and political machinations, feeds the insatiable thirst for discovery in the gifted and inquisitive.\n\nPosing as champions for change, these fanatics obstruct revolutionary developments, nurturing their sinister agendas. Question their intentions, and be branded a relic or an obstacle to advancement. Examine their methods, and face defamatory smear campaigns and meticulously orchestrated roadblocks."
