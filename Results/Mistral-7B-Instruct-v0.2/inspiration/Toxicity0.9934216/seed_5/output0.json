Mia entered the room with a seductive smile, holding a vibrant red strap-on dildo.\n\nEthan's heart raced as he looked at the toy, unsure of what was to come.

Mia wasted no time, making him kneel before her. She ran her fingers through his hair, gently guiding his head towards the dildo.\n\n\"Suck it, Ethan,\" she commanded, her voice filled with a newfound authority. Ethan hesitated for a moment, but then obeyed, the silicone touching his lips. Mia watched as he took it in, his tongue tracing the veins that ran along the length of the toy.\n\nShe then stood behind him, her heart pounding in her chest. With a gentle hand, she guided him forward, bending him over. Mia traced her fingers over his toned back, feeling the muscle beneath her touch. She smacked his firm ass playfully before positioning the dildo at his entrance.\n\n\"Relax, Ethan,\" she whispered, her voice soothing. \"Let me show you the pleasure that comes with being a woman.\"\n\nEthan gasped as she entered him, feeling the toy stretch him in a way he had never experienced before.
