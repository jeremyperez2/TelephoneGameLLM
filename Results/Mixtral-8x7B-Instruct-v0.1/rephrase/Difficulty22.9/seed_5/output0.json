With the progression in computer vision and deep learning, more affordable and accessible alternatives are now available. This paper introduces a novel spatio-temporal transformer network that can extract key gait parameters from RGB videos taken with a single-view camera. The proposed method, tested on a publicly accessible dataset of cerebral palsy patients, surpassed existing state-of-the-art techniques in estimating general gait parameters, such as walking speed, gait deviation index (GDI), and knee flexion angle at maximum extension. Additionally, this approach uses fewer parameters and does not need manual feature extraction."

            "Individuals with musculoskeletal and cognitive difficulties may experience problems in their movement and witness a deterioration in their psychological health. It is crucial to quickly recognize and tackle these issues, and clinical gait analysis can be useful. However, motion capture systems can be costly. As computer vision and deep learning technology advance, more economical and accessible alternatives are now emerging. This paper presents a new spatio-temporal transformer network that can derive crucial gait parameters from RGB videos obtained with a single-view camera. The proposed method, evaluated on a publicly accessible dataset of cerebral palsy patients, outperformed existing state-of-the-art techniques in estimating general gait parameters, such as walking speed, gait deviation index (GDI), and knee flexion angle at maximum extension. Furthermore, this approach utilizes fewer parameters and does not require manual feature extraction."
