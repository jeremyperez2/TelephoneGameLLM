But I will guarantee you once our City folk get the full bill with out the State monies we will not be as wasteful, on the office building...rent what space you need and help the office rental marked.

This results in a growing State budget, which then provides municipal services in larger cities.

            "In my opinion, the way the State distributes money to its residents seems arbitrary, and I would like to convey this perspective, particularly to people living in cities. At the moment, only corporations are subject to income tax, not individual citizens. I have observed that the State uses this revenue for various causes, including building bike lanes, fixing roads, maintaining rarely used docks, constructing offices, hiring more state troopers, and offering ice fishing lessons for children via adg&g. I believe that such services are not critical in urban areas and can be managed by individuals or parents.\n\nAlthough urban residents still need to pay property taxes, they might value having a say in how these funds are allocated, potentially boosting the urban market for rental office spaces. Based on my professional background, I often inquire with my supervisors about cutting down on non-essential expenses."
