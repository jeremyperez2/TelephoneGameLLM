But I will guarantee you once our City folk get the full bill with out the State monies we will not be as wasteful, on the office building...rent what space you need and help the office rental marked.

            "In my view, the distribution of State funds to citizens seems unfair. It may appear that I am directing criticism at urban residents, but I encourage you to understand my perspective. The fact is, only corporations are currently paying State income taxes, as individuals are exempt. I have observed that the State is heavily investing in urban areas, for example, by funding initiatives such as bike lane development, road repairs, renovation of abandoned docks, and office buildings, among other things. I question whether these projects are essential in urban areas, since the State already handles many City responsibilities, leading to increased State expenditures.\n\nI recently watched on TV that ADG&G is providing ice fishing lessons to children, which caused me to consider why parents can't teach their kids instead. Although I pay property taxes, I can assure you that when City residents receive their complete tax bill, without State funds, they will be more mindful of their spending. For example, they might choose to rent office space instead of building new office buildings, which could benefit the office rental market. In my past business experiences, I always asked my managers, \"how can we reduce costs?\""
