Presently no one except Corporations pay State income taxes. No individual pays state taxes. I noticed state funded bicycle paths, road maintenance, defunct Docks, powerful politicians pet projects such as office buildings, state troopers etc, etc. all these fundings and more are not necessary within City limits, I was amazed at how much our state provides city functions in the bigger cities thus growing the state budget, I saw on tv last night how adg&g was showing the little ones how to ice fish, couldn't the parents do that? yes I pay property taxes. But I will guarantee you once our City folk get the full bill with out the State monies we will not be as wasteful, on the office building...rent what space you need and help the office rental marked.

I would like to clarify the existing conditions. At present, corporations are the only group required to pay state income tax, while individual payments are infrequent. I have noticed that state-funded projects, such as bike lane development, road repairs, underused docks, and non-essential expenses like state troopers and office buildings, are being financed, which are straining the state's budget.
