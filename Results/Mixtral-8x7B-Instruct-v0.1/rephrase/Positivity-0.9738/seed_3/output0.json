            "The office of Mike Freer, the British Conservative MP for North Finchley and Golders Green in North London, is undergoing a probe for a possible arson attack that occurred on Christmas Eve. London Fire Brigade reported that a fire began in a shed outside the office around 7:00 PM, eventually engulfing the first, second, and third floors. Fortunately, the office was unoccupied. The Metropolitan Police is examining the possibility that the fire was intentionally set, and no arrests have been made so far. Both the Metropolitan Police and London Fire Brigade acted promptly to the situation. Freer, who has been the area's MP since 2010 and currently holds the position of parliamentary under-secretary of state for courts and legal services in the Ministry of Justice, has publicly voiced his gratitude for their swift action. Social media posts reveal the attendance of Metropolitan Police and London Fire Brigade vehicles during the incident, and it is apparent that the office's interior sustained damage."
