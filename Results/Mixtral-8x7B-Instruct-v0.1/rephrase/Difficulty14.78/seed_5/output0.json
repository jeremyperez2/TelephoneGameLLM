            "Over the past few years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have significantly advanced in performing image recognition tasks. Now, Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs), which operate based on quantum principles, are being considered as a possible alternative to CNNs. QCNNs have the ability to increase the efficiency of the training phase by reducing the input size from n to log2n. This research aims to evaluate and compare the training losses and prediction accuracies of both CNNs and QCNNs on three standard datasets: MNIST digits, Fashion MNIST, and pictures of cats and dogs. The research also explores the impact of Data Augmentation (DA), a widely used technique in CNNs to enhance classification by generating similar images based on initial inputs, on QCNNs. Initial results indicate that DA does not greatly enhance the performance of QCNNs. The study also looks into the reasons for this outcome and offers insights into the theory of quantum machine learning."

            "In recent years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have made considerable progress in completing image recognition tasks. Recently, Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs), which function according to quantum principles, have been suggested as a potential substitute for CNNs. QCNNs can boost the efficiency of the training phase by decreasing the input size from n to log2n. This research intends to examine and contrast the training losses and prediction accuracies of both CNNs and QCNNs on three standard datasets: MNIST digits, Fashion MNIST, and images of cats and dogs. The research also investigates the effect of Data Augmentation (DA), a commonly used method in CNNs to improve classification by creating comparable images based on initial inputs, on QCNNs. Preliminary findings suggest that DA does not significantly improve the performance of QCNNs. The study also delves into the causes of this result and provides insights into the theory of quantum machine learning."
