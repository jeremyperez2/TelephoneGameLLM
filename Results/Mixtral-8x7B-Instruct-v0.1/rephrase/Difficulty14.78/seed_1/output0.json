            "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved significant results in tasks involving images. Now, Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs), which use quantum mechanics principles to increase efficiency, are emerging. One notable benefit of QCNNs is their capacity to reduce the input size from *n* to *log*2*n* during the training phase by utilizing quantum concepts, thereby accelerating the process. This research explores and compares the performance of CNNs and QCNNs, considering metrics like loss and prediction accuracy for datasets like MNIST digits, Fashion MNIST, and images of cats and dogs. The research also examines the influence of Data Augmentation (DA), a technique frequently used in CNNs to enhance classification results by generating similar images based on the initial inputs, on QCNNs. Preliminary findings suggest that QCNNs do not benefit from DA. The research continues to explore the causes behind this observation to advance the field of quantum machine learning."

            "CNNs have had great success in image-related tasks, and now Quantum Conural Neural Networks (QCNNs), which apply quantum mechanics principles to improve efficiency, are becoming popular. A key advantage of QCNNs is their ability to decrease the input size from *n* to *log*2*n* during training, thanks to quantum concepts, which speeds up the process. This study examines and evaluates the performance of CNNs and QCNNs, looking at metrics like loss and prediction accuracy for datasets like MNIST digits, Fashion MNIST, and pictures of cats and dogs. The research also investigates how Data Augmentation (DA), a technique often used in CNNs to enhance classification by creating similar images based on the original inputs, affects QCNNs. Initial results indicate that QCNNs do not gain from DA. The study continues to look into the reasons behind this finding to further the development of quantum machine learning."
