This paper examines and evaluates the performance of both CNNs and QCNNs, specifically looking at their loss and prediction accuracy on three well-known datasets: MNIST hand-written digits, Fashion MNIST, and cat/dog face images. The research also explores the effect of Data Augmentation (DA) on QCNNs, a technique frequently used in CNNs to increase classification by creating similar images based on the original inputs. However, the implementation of DA did not significantly improve the performance of QCNNs. The goal of this study is to understand the reason behind this observation to enhance the understanding of quantum machine learning theory."
