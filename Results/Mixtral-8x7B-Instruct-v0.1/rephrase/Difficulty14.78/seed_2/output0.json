            "In the last few years, traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been successful in image recognition tasks. Recently, Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs), a form of CNNs that integrates quantum mechanics to enhance efficiency, have risen in popularity. The primary distinction between QCNNs and CNNs is the addition of a quantum element that reduces the input size from n to log2n during training, thereby accelerating the process. This paper examines and contrasts the loss and prediction accuracy of both CNNs and QCNNs when utilized for MNIST (handwritten digits), Fashion MNIST, and cat/dog picture datasets. Additionally, this research explores the impact of Data Augmentation (DA), a technique that increases CNNs' classification capabilities, on QCNNs. It is interesting to note that DA has not improved QCNNs' performance, and this study aims to examine the causes of this to deepen our comprehension of quantum machine learning theory."
