A major obstacle in creating an automated system to scrutinize these triangles has been the intricacy of the data, limited data availability, and the complexity of the underlying physical processes. This often demands human intervention for data annotation and confirmation.\n\nThe suggested approach utilizes unsupervised computer vision techniques, such as segmentation, to directly identify and assess bias triangle features. This reduces the need for human intervention and extensive datasets required in supervised learning methods. Furthermore, this method allows for automatic pixel-wise labeling of shapes and features, accurately and efficiently detecting Pauli spin blockade (PSB) without the need for training data."

            "A novel approach is being developed that targets the analysis of graph structures in quantum dot (QD) systems, with specific interest in unique features known as \"bias triangles\" which significantly affect spin physics. The complexity of the data and concepts, coupled with the limited data accessibility, often makes automatic assessment challenging, typically requiring expert-led manual review.\n\nThis latest method utilizes unsupervised computer vision techniques, such as segmentation, to swiftly and precisely identify and assess bias triangles. This reduction in human intervention and large datasets, usually required in supervised learning methods, is enabled through this approach. Furthermore, this method facilitates automatic and accurate pixel-level labeling of shapes and features, allowing for the detection of Pauli spin blockade (PSB) without the necessity for training data."
