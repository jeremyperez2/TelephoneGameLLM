            "The primary focus of stability graphs for quantum dot (QD) devices is usually to examine spin physics via bias triangles. It is important to analyze these triangles by distinguishing and assessing their characteristics, but several issues can arise, such as low data quality, limited data availability, and the intricacy of related physical processes. Human involvement is typically required in the analysis system to identify and confirm these triangles. This paper introduces an analytical framework using unsupervised computer vision techniques, in particular segmentation, to detect and categorize bias triangle features, thus eliminating the need for human intervention or large datasets required by supervised learning methods. This technique also automates pixel-wise classification of shape and features. We show that this method can accurately and quickly detect Pauli spin blockade (PSB) without the use of training data."
