            "The Prince and Princess of Wales have posted a black and white photo on social media, taken by Josh Shinner, that is similar to their holiday card. The image features their three children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis, dressed in matching outfits and seated on a wooden bench, echoing the arrangement of their Christmas card. Prior to this, the royal family had already released a separate black and white picture for their Christmas card, depicting the Princess of Wales and Princess Charlotte in jeans, the Prince of Wales in black pants, and the two princes in shorts. At the moment, the British royal family is celebrating Christmas Day at Sandringham in Norfolk, which involves attending a morning church service. It's noteworthy that the Princess of Wales recently organized the Together At Christmas carol service event at Westminster Abbey, which was aired on Christmas Eve."
