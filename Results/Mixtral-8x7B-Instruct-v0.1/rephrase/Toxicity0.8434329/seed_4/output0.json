To give an example, a person we know with Alzheimer's and a broken hip was discharged from St. Mary's in Grand Junction without any follow-up medical appointments or arrangements for care at another Alzheimer's facility, which is not acceptable.\n\nDespite the closure of this institution last year to improve care for complex cases, it appears that the level of care has not gotten better. It's troubling that drug users and emergency room patients are still receiving medical attention, while elderly individuals with health problems are being overlooked. This concerning trend has resulted in a decrease in public trust in the healthcare system and a lack of support for those who fail to advocate for proper end-of-life care. This unfortunate situation should cause regret among politicians who have not yet passed laws to protect these vulnerable elderly individuals."
