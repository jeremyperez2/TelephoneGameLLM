This is unacceptable.\n\nUnfortunately, the facility closed down last year, relocating its special needs residents to Denver, which is less than ideal. It appears that our healthcare system prioritizes financial gains over empathy. Even more concerning is that drug users and emergency room managers can access healthcare services, while the elderly with health issues are overlooked and mistreated.
