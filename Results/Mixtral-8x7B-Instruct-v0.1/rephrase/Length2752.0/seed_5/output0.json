            "A sergeant from the United States Army, who was previously based in South Korea, is currently in the custody of Russia, as confirmed by the U.S. military. The Russian foreign ministry has stated that the arrest is not because of political motivations or spying, but is due to a minor, non-political offense. This 34-year-old soldier was not on an official mission when he was apprehended in Vladivostok, Russia, on May 2nd. He was traveling from China to Russia for personal reasons, not associated with his duties at Fort Cavazos, Texas. Reports suggest that the soldier was visiting a woman he had a romantic relationship with, which his mother has verified. The U.S. Army has revealed that the soldier did not seek official approval for his travel to China or Russia and there is no indication that he intended to stay in Russia. On May 3rd, the Russian interior ministry informed the U.S. embassy in Moscow that the soldier was arrested for theft and is being detained at a pre-trial detention center. The U.S. Army has contacted his family and the U.S. Department of State is offering consular assistance. The U.S. is keeping a close eye on this situation and other related issues concerning Russia, as stated by the spokesman for the National Security Council. Furthermore, Russia is holding two other Americans, including Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who was arrested in March 2023 on charges of espionage, and former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan, who was sentenced to 16 years in prison in 2020 on accusations of spying. Both individuals have declared their innocence, and the U.S. government asserts that the accusations against them are unfounded."
