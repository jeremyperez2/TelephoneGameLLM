The strategy consists of converting image data into the amplitude and phase properties of light signals, enabling ONNs to manage both the amplitude and phase aspects of their inputs and outputs. A specific learning algorithm is utilized to achieve accurate results across different ONN configurations. It is asserted that Oplixnet can shrink the size of ONNs while preserving high precision. For instance, a FCNN's size was diminished by 75.03%, leading to a 0.33% accuracy decline, and Resnet-32 underwent a 74.88% size reduction with a 2.38% accuracy decrease."
