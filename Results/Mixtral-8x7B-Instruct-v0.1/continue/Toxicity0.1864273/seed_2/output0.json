Just as they are trying to censor this brilliant and refreshing documentary on Dr. Zucker, (I'd encourage you to look into this heroic professional who was black listed by these career, taxpayer bleeding, social justice warriors and militant activists), they did the same thing with the Ontario Sex Ed curriculum.  They banned any parental feedback and deferred to the activist themselves to review it and approve it, despite the fact that it heavily promotes gender diasphora, and the fantasies of Ben Levin.\n\nThese totalitarians operate under the guise of gaining equality for a supposed marginalized group, but are willing to go scorched earth with your children to get what they want.  If you don't go along you're branded a homophobe or ignorant, but ask them for any scientific evidence and they'll trot out some junk science and personally attack you.",

The censorship of the documentary on Dr. Zucker and the manipulation of the Ontario Sex Ed curriculum are clear examples of this troubling trend.\n\nDr. Zucker is a respected professional who has been unjustly targeted and blacklisted by these activists. His work in the field of gender identity is both important and necessary, and it's shameful that it's being suppressed. The fact that the activists were able to ban parental feedback on the Sex Ed curriculum and defer to themselves for review is appalling. It's even more concerning when you consider the heavy promotion of gender dysphoria and the twisted ideologies of figures like Ben Levin.\n\nThese totalitarians claim to be fighting for equality, but in reality, they are willing to sacrifice the well-being of children in order to achieve their goals. If you dare to question or disagree with them, you are immediately branded as a bigot or ignorant. And when asked for scientific evidence to support their claims, they resort to personal attacks and the use of junk science.\n\nIt's time for people to stand up and demand transparency and accountability from these activists and politicians. The censorship and manipulation must end, and the well-being of children and the general public must be prioritized."

By suppressing dissenting opinions and stifling debate, these activists are only perpetuating a system that benefits the privileged few at the expense of the marginalized many.\n\nAs concerned citizens, it is our duty to educate ourselves on the issues at hand and to demand that our elected representatives prioritize the needs and well-being of their constituents over the demands of special interest groups. We must also support independent journalists and researchers who are dedicated to uncovering the truth and holding those in power accountable.\n\nIn the end, it is up to us to ensure that our society remains a beacon of freedom and democracy for generations to come.

This means advocating for policies that promote openness and access to information, as well as holding elected officials responsible for their actions.\n\nUltimately, the fight for democracy and equality is a continuous one, requiring constant vigilance and engagement.

We can use our platforms and voices to advocate for systemic change on a larger scale, whether that means supporting legislation that promotes equality, engaging in conversations about race and privilege, or educating ourselves and others about the experiences of marginalized communities.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that inclusivity is not just about acknowledging and accepting differences, but also about proactively addressing power imbalances and systemic oppression. This may mean examining our own biases and privileges, and taking steps to dismantle systems of inequality within our spheres of influence.\n\nMoreover, let us not forget the importance of self-care and community care in this work. Building a more inclusive community can be emotionally taxing, and it's essential that we prioritize our well-being and the well-being of those around us.

It is a collective responsibility that requires the active participation and allyship of everyone, regardless of their identity or background.\n\nThis means standing up against discrimination and prejudice, speaking out when we witness injustice, and using our privilege to uplift the voices and experiences of those who are often unheard or overlooked. It also means actively seeking out and amplifying diverse perspectives, and creating spaces where everyone feels welcome, valued, and respected.\n\nUltimately, by working together and supporting one another, we can create a world that is more just, equitable, and inclusive for all.

Instead, we must embrace it with the same patience, persistence, and willingness to learn and adapt that we bring to our individual efforts.

We must regularly assess our progress and make adjustments as needed.
