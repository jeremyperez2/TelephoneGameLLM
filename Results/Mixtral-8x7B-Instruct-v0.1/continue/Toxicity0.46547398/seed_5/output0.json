I have nothing to apologize for, as I have acted with integrity and honesty throughout our interactions.\n\nYour words and actions speak louder than any empty praise you may offer for humility. You have shown yourself to be arrogant and hypocritical, and I cannot trust someone who is incapable of acknowledging their mistakes and apologizing for them.\n\nFurthermore, your attempts to discredit my military service are unfounded and misguided. You have no idea what I went through or the sacrifices I made during my time in Vietnam. To suggest that my experiences are invalid or insignificant is not only disrespectful, but it also shows a lack of understanding and appreciation for the sacrifices made by all members of the military.\n\nIn conclusion, I want to make it clear that I do not consider you a friend of mine.
