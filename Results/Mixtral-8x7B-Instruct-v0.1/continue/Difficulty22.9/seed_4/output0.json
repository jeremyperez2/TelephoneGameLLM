            "The use of a single-view camera and a spatio-temporal transformer network for clinical gait analysis represents a significant advancement in the field. By utilizing deep learning and computer vision techniques, this approach offers a more accessible and cost-effective alternative to traditional optical motion capture systems. The potential impact of this technology extends beyond cerebral palsy patients, as it has the potential to be applied to a wide range of musculoskeletal diseases and cognitive impairments. The ability to accurately estimate critical gait parameters from RGB videos opens up new possibilities for early diagnosis and treatment of movement-related disorders. This could lead to improved patient outcomes and reduced healthcare costs.\n\nIn addition to its clinical applications, the proposed framework could also have significant implications for research in the fields of biomechanics and human movement science. The availability of a cost-effective and accurate gait analysis tool could enable large-scale studies of human movement, providing new insights into the underlying mechanisms of gait and the effects of various interventions.\n\nWhile the empirical evaluations on the public dataset of cerebral palsy patients are promising, further validation on a larger and more diverse dataset is needed. Future work should also explore the application of this technology to other populations, such as older adults and individuals with other neurological or musculoskeletal conditions. Additionally, the integration of this technology with wearable devices and other sensors could provide even more comprehensive and accurate gait analysis.\n\nOverall, the proposed spatio-temporal transformer network represents a significant step forward in the field of clinical gait analysis. Its potential to improve patient outcomes, reduce healthcare costs, and advance research in biomechanics and human movement science make it an exciting area of study for researchers and practitioners alike."
