You cheated by making snowballs in advance and hiding them in your pockets.\"\n\nThey both share a hearty laugh, remembering the playful moment from years ago.

It added an element of excitement and surprise to the meal.\"\n\nThe Duchess nods in agreement and shares, \"In my family, we would always go for a walk after Christmas dinner, no matter the weather. It was a way for us to bond and appreciate the beauty of nature, even in the midst of winter.\"\n\nAs they continue to share memories, the couple is interrupted by the sound of laughter and footsteps approaching from another room.
