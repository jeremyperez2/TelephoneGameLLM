The \"authorities\" closed the facility to accommodate \"challenged \" residents here last year and re-located them to Denver.  Again, ridiculous!  Our health care system is without compassion and based on the bottom line!  The worst part is drug addicts, emergency room mangers of all sorts can get care but we treat those who have health issues as seniors like shit! Sad state of affairs!

The fact that facilities are being closed and resources are being shifted, leaving patients and their families in difficult situations, is a clear indication that the system is broken.\n\nThe prioritization of profits over people is a systemic issue that needs to be addressed. It's appalling that those who struggle with addiction or other emergent health issues are able to receive care, while seniors with complex health needs are left to fend for themselves. This is not only unjust, but it also goes against the very principles of compassion and dignity that our healthcare system should uphold.\n\nPoliticians must be held accountable for their lack of support for bills that would improve end-of-life care for our seniors. It's time for us to take a stand and demand better for our loved ones and all those who are in need of care and support. We must continue to fight for a healthcare system that truly serves the needs of all its patients, regardless of their age or health status."

This means taking care of our physical, emotional, and mental well-being, and creating a work environment that supports this. It also means being kind to ourselves and each other, and recognizing that setbacks and mistakes are a natural part of the learning and growth process.\n\nFinally, let us always keep in mind the ultimate goal of our work: to improve the health and well-being of individuals and communities around the world.

By creating a shared sense of ownership and accountability for DEI, organizations can build a more inclusive culture that benefits everyone. This may involve partnering with external organizations that specialize in DEI, seeking input from diversity and inclusion experts, and involving employees in the development and implementation of the DEI strategy.\n\nAnother important factor in a successful DEI strategy is ensuring that there are clear policies and procedures in place to address discrimination, harassment, and bias. This includes having a zero-tolerance policy for discrimination and harassment, as well as providing clear channels for reporting incidents and addressing concerns. By creating a safe and respectful workplace, organizations can foster a culture of trust, transparency, and accountability.\n\nIn addition, organizations must recognize that DEI is not just about hiring and promoting diverse talent; it's also about creating a culture where diverse perspectives are valued and included in decision-making processes.

            "It's worth noting that a successful DEI strategy must also address intersectionality, which recognizes the ways in which different forms of discrimination can intersect and overlap. For example, a person who identifies as both LGBTQ+ and a person of color may face unique challenges and forms of discrimination that are not captured by focusing on either identity alone. By acknowledging and addressing intersectionality, organizations can create a more nuanced and inclusive understanding of diversity and ensure that all employees feel seen, heard, and valued.\n\nMoreover, it's important to recognize that DEI efforts must be ongoing and not just a one-time initiative. Creating a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace requires a long-term commitment to change and a willingness to adapt and evolve based on feedback and changing circumstances. This means regularly reviewing and updating policies and procedures, providing ongoing education and training, and creating opportunities for dialogue and feedback.\n\nFinally, it's essential to measure the impact of DEI efforts and hold ourselves accountable for progress.
