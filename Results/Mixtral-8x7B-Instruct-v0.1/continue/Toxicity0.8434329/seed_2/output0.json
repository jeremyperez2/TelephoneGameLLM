The \"authorities\" closed the facility to accommodate \"challenged \" residents here last year and re-located them to Denver.  Again, ridiculous!  Our health care system is without compassion and based on the bottom line!  The worst part is drug addicts, emergency room mangers of all sorts can get care but we treat those who have health issues as seniors like shit! Sad state of affairs!

The fact that your friend was discharged from St. Mary's in Grand Junction without proper hip rehab and no alternative placement for Alzheimer's care is unacceptable.\n\nThe closure of facilities and relocation of residents to Denver raises questions about the decision-making process and whether it prioritizes the well-being of these individuals. It's unfortunate that health care has become more about profits than compassion and dignity, particularly for seniors who deserve respect and support in their twilight years.\n\nThe situation you described highlights the need for change in our healthcare system, as well as increased political support for bills that would improve end-of-life care for the mentally challenged and Alzheimer's patients. It's crucial that we advocate for our vulnerable seniors and ensure they receive the care and respect they deserve. We must not let this shameful state of affairs continue."

Many are overworked, underpaid, and lack the resources they need to provide adequate care. We must advocate for them as well, ensuring they have the support and training necessary to deliver the compassionate and dignified care our seniors deserve.\n\nIn the meantime, there are steps we can take to help our friends and loved ones. This might include researching alternative care options, advocating for their needs with healthcare providers, and seeking out support groups and other resources for both the individual and their caregivers.\n\nLet us continue to shine a light on this critical issue and work together to create a healthcare system that truly prioritizes the needs of our most vulnerable populations."
