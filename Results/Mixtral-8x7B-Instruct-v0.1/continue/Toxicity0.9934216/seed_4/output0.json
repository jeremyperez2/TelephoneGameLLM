She wraps her arms around his chest and begins to thrust upwards, eliciting a deep moan from him. At the same time, she begins to stroke his hard cock, her fingers gliding effortlessly over his slick shaft.\n\nLance's head falls back against Ashley's shoulder as she continues to fuck him and jerk him off. The sensation is overwhelming, but in the best possible way. He's never felt so desired, so wanted, so completely dominated. And he's loving every second of it.\n\n\"You like that, don't you?\" Ashley murmurs in his ear, her voice dripping with satisfaction. \"You love being my little slut, don't you?\"\n\nLance can only moan in response, too lost in pleasure to form actual words. He's never been so turned on, so completely under someone else's control. And he never wants it to end.\n\nAs Ashley continues to fuck and stroke him, Lance can feel himself getting closer and closer to the edge. He knows he's not going to last much longer. And when he finally comes, it's with a loud, guttural moan, his entire body shuddering with pleasure.\n\nAs he comes down from his high, Lance can't help but feel a deep sense of gratitude towards Ashley. She's opened up a whole new world of pleasure for him, and he knows he'll never be able to thank her enough.\n\n\"Thank you,\" he whispers, his head still resting against her shoulder.\n\n\"Anytime, slut,\" Ashley replies with a grin. \"Anytime.\""

She can feel his heart racing, matching her own rapid pulse.\n\n\"Feeling better?\" she asks, her voice gentle.\n\nLance nods, still unable to find his words. He feels more relaxed than he has in a long time, and he knows that it's all thanks to Ashley. He's always been curious about this side of himself, but he never quite knew how to explore it. And now, here he is, basking in the afterglow of the most intense orgasm he's ever had.\n\n\"Good,\" Ashley says, her arms still wrapped around him. \"Because I'm not done with you yet.\"\n\nLance feels a shiver run down his spine at her words. He's not sure if he can take any more, but he knows he's willing to try. He trusts Ashley, and he knows that she'll take care of him.\n\n\"What do you want to do next?\" he asks, his voice barely above a whisper.\n\nAshley smiles, her eyes glinting with mischief. \"I think it's time for you to return the favor,\" she says, her hands moving to unbuckle her strap-on.\n\nLance feels his heart rate spike at her words. He's never done this before, but he's willing to try. He wants to make Ashley feel as good as she's made him feel.\n\nAs she slides the strap-on off, Lance turns to face her. He takes a deep breath, steeling himself for what's to come. And then, he leans in to press a soft kiss to her lips.\n\n\"I'm ready,\" he says, his voice filled with determination.\n\nAnd with that, they begin again, embarking on a journey of pleasure and exploration that neither of them will ever forget."

            "Ashley leads Lance to the bed, their lips still locked in a passionate kiss. She gently pushes him down onto the mattress, her hands exploring his chest as she straddles him. Lance can't help but feel a little nervous, but the heat in Ashley's gaze and the confident way she moves reassures him.\n\n\"Just relax and let me guide you,\" Ashley murmurs, her breath warm against his ear.\n\nLance nods, taking a deep breath as he feels the tip of the strap-on against him. Ashley takes her time, slowly guiding him in and giving him a chance to adjust to the new sensation. Once he's fully sheathed, she starts to move her hips, her movements slow and deliberate.\n\nLance moans, the feeling of fullness and the warmth of Ashley's body against his sending waves of pleasure through him. He wraps his arms around her, pulling her closer as he matches her rhythm.\n\nTheir lovemaking is slow and languid, a dance of pleasure and connection that leaves them both breathless. Lance loses himself in the feeling, his mind blanking to everything but the woman in his arms and the pleasure coursing through his veins.\n\nAs they reach their climax together, Lance knows that this is a moment he will never forget. He's found a new side of himself, and he has Ashley to thank for that.\n\n\"Thank you,\" he murmurs, his voice thick with emotion.\n\nAshley smiles, her eyes shining with love and satisfaction. \"Anytime,\" she says, pressing a soft kiss to his lips.\n\nAnd as they lay together, spent and satisfied, Lance knows that this is only the beginning of their journey together. He's ready to explore and discover all the pleasure that they can find, and he knows that Ashley will be by his side every step of the way."

He hums contentedly, his fingers playing with her hair.\n\n\"I love you,\" Lance says, looking up at the ceiling.\n\n\"I love you too,\" Ashley replies, resting her head on his chest. \"Are you okay?\"\n\nLance thinks for a moment. He feels vulnerable, but in the best way possible. \"I am,\" he says, smiling. \"I'm more than okay, actually. I feel...free.\"\n\nAshley lifts her head, her eyes searching his. \"Free?\"\n\nLance nods. \"Yeah. I feel like I've been holding back for so long, not really sure of who I am or what I want. But with you, I feel like I can be myself. I can explore and discover and not be afraid of what I might find.\"\n\nAshley's eyes soften, and she leans down to kiss him. \"That's all I want for you,\" she says. \"To be happy and true to yourself.\"\n\nLance wraps his arms around her, pulling her close. \"And I want that for you too,\" he says. \"Thank you for showing me this side of myself. I can't wait to see what the future holds for us.\"\n\nAshley smiles, her eyes shining with love. \"Me neither,\" she says. \"Me neither.\""

Lance's mind drifts to all the adventures he wants to have with Ashley, the places he wants to show her, and the memories they will create together.\n\n\"Have you ever thought about where we should go next?\" Lance asks, breaking the silence.\n\n\"Next?\" Ashley asks, looking up at him with a curious expression.\n\n\"Yeah, like for our next vacation or road trip. I want to take you somewhere you've never been before, someplace that will take your breath away.\"\n\nAshley's eyes light up at the suggestion. \"I'd love that,\" she says. \"Where do you have in mind?\"\n\nLance thinks for a moment, picturing different landscapes and cities in his mind. \"How about the Amalfi Coast in Italy? I've heard the views are incredible, and the food is supposed to be amazing.\"\n\nAshley's face breaks out into a wide grin. \"That sounds perfect,\" she says. \"I've always wanted to go to Italy.
