She starts to thrust into him with renewed energy, the sound of her hips slapping against his ass filling the room. Lance's cries of pleasure grow louder and more desperate as she fucks him, his own cock rock-hard and bouncing with every movement.\n\nAshley reaches around and takes hold of Lance's dick, giving it a few experimental tugs. He moans even louder, bucking his hips back to meet her thrusts. She starts to jerk him off in time with her thrusts, her other hand snaking around to play with his nipples. Lance is in heaven, completely under Ashley's control and loving every second of it.\n\nJust when he thinks he can't take any more, Ashley pulls out and flips him over onto his back. She climbs on top of him, straddling his hips and guiding the strap-on back inside him. She leans down and kisses him deeply, their tongues dancing together as she starts to ride him again. Lance wraps his arms around her, pulling her closer and surrendering himself completely to the pleasure she's giving him.\n\nAs they fuck, Ashley reaches down and starts to rub Lance's cock again. He's so turned on that it doesn't take long before he's moaning and bucking his hips, his orgasm building deep inside him. Ashley feels him start to tense up and increases her pace, fucking him harder and faster until he can't take it any more.\n\nWith a cry of pure pleasure, Lance comes hard, his hot load spurting out and coating Ashley's hand. She milks every last drop out of him, then collapses on top of him, both of them panting and sweating.\n\n\"Well, I think it's safe to say you're a total girl now,\" Ashley says with a laugh, kissing Lance gently on the lips.\n\nHe grins up at her, still breathless from his orgasm. \"I guess I am. And I have to say, I'm loving every minute of it.\"\n\nAshley laughs and wraps her arms around him, holding him close. \"I'm glad. Because I have a feeling this is just the beginning.\""

He's always known that Ashley is special, but this experience has brought them even closer together.\n\n\"I love you, Ashley,\" he says, looking into her eyes.\n\n\"I love you too, Lance,\" she replies, kissing him deeply. \"And I can't wait to see what other adventures we have together.\"\n\nAs they lay there, wrapped in each other's arms, Lance knows that no matter what the future holds, he'll always have Ashley by his side.

As they sleep, their bodies entwined, they unconsciously seek comfort and security in each other's embrace.\n\nHours later, Lance stirs awake, his arm still draped over Ashley's waist. He looks at her peaceful face and feels a sense of contentment wash over him. He can't believe how lucky he is to have found someone like her.\n\nQuietly, so as not to wake her, Lance gets up and walks over to the window, staring out at the twinkling city lights below. He thinks about how much his life has changed since he met Ashley. She has brought so much joy and happiness into his world, and he can't imagine his life without her.\n\nAs if sensing his thoughts, Ashley stirs awake and walks over to him, wrapping her arms around his waist. \"What are you thinking about?\" she asks, her breath warm against his back.\n\n\"Just about how lucky I am to have you,\" he replies, turning around to face her.\n\n\"I'm the lucky one,\" she says, smiling up at him. \"Because I have you.\"\n\nLance leans down to kiss her, feeling his love for her grow stronger with each passing moment.

She knew that Lance was the one for her, and she couldn't wait to see what the future held for them.\n\nAs the days turned into weeks, and the weeks into months, Lance and Ashley's love for each other only grew stronger. They faced challenges and obstacles along the way, but they always found a way to overcome them, thanks to their unwavering love and support for each other.\n\nOne day, Lance decided to take Ashley to the place where they first met. He wanted to remind her of the moment that changed both of their lives forever. As they stood there, looking into each other's eyes, Lance pulled out a ring and got down on one knee.\n\n\"Ashley, I know that we've only just met, but I also know that I want to spend the rest of my life with you. Will you marry me?\" he asked, his voice shaking with emotion.\n\nAshley's eyes filled with tears as she nodded her head. \"Yes, Lance. I will marry you,\" she said, as she threw her arms around him.\n\nAnd so, under the warm glow of the setting sun, Lance and Ashley began their journey together as husband and wife, promising to love and cherish each other for the rest of their lives."

As they exchanged their vows, Lance and Ashley looked into each other's eyes and knew that they had found their soulmate.\n\nThe years passed, and Lance and Ashley built a life together filled with love and joy. They faced challenges and hardships, but they always faced them together, their bond only growing stronger with each passing day. They welcomed children into their family, and watched as they grew and thrived under their love and guidance.\n\nAs they grew older, Lance and Ashley never lost their love for each other. They still held hands and shared kisses, still looked into each other's eyes with the same love and adoration they had felt on that first day.\n\nAnd so, as they sat on their porch, watching the sunset on their golden years, Lance and Ashley knew that they had built something beautiful and lasting. Their love had been the foundation of their life together, and it was a testament to the power of love and commitment.\n\nThey knew that their time together was drawing to a close, but they also knew that their love would live on, a beacon of hope and inspiration for all who knew them.
