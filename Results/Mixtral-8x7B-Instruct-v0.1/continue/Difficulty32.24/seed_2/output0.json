            "The development of such a classification system is long overdue, as the field of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography has grown exponentially in recent years with the advent of digital technology. This paper seeks to bring order to this complex landscape by establishing clear criteria for differentiating between various types of electronic lexicographic resources.\n\nOne key distinction that this paper will explore is the difference between dictionaries, platforms, and websites. While all three of these types of resources may contain multilingual or plurilingual content, they serve different purposes and therefore merit separate classification. Dictionaries are typically focused on providing definitions and translations for specific words or phrases, while platforms and websites may offer a wider range of language-related tools and resources.\n\nAnother important factor to consider in this classification system is the degree of prototyping of the resources in question. Some electronic lexicographic resources may be highly prototypical, meaning that they closely adhere to traditional definitions and formats for dictionaries and other language tools. Others, however, may be more experimental in nature, pushing the boundaries of what is considered a \"dictionary\" or \"lexicographic resource.\"\n\nIn addition to offering a thorough description of the different resources and establishing a classification system, this paper will also propose a number of parameters for defining and demarcating various types of electronic lexicographic resources. These parameters will be based on a variety of factors, including the scope and focus of the resource, the languages and language varieties included, the types of information and tools provided, and the overall design and user experience.\n\nFinally, this paper will also question the object of study of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography. As the field continues to evolve and expand, it is important to consider what exactly we are studying when we examine multilingual and plurilingual dictionaries and other language tools. Is it the words and phrases themselves, the ways in which they are defined and translated, the technologies used to create and deliver the resources, or something else entirely? By exploring these questions, this paper aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the field of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography and its potential future directions."
        ],
        [
            "Furthermore, it is crucial to take into account the target audience of these electronic lexicographic resources. Some resources are designed for language learners, providing accessible and user-friendly interfaces to facilitate language acquisition. Others, however, are aimed at linguists, translators, and other language professionals, offering more advanced features and specialized terminology.\n\nIn addition, the issue of standardization and norms in multilingual and plurilingual lexicography must be addressed. As the field grows and evolves, there is a need for clear standards and guidelines to ensure consistency and accuracy across different resources. This includes not only the content of the resources themselves but also their metadata, such as title, description, and keywords, which are essential for discoverability and accessibility.\n\nTo develop a comprehensive classification system, it is also necessary to consider the role of artificial intelligence and natural language processing in electronic lexicographic resources. Many modern resources use machine learning algorithms and other advanced techniques to provide more sophisticated language tools, such as automated translation, text analysis, and language modeling. These technologies raise new challenges and opportunities for multilingual and plurilingual lexicography, requiring a reevaluation of existing categories and criteria.\n\nIn conclusion, this paper proposes a new classification system for electronic lexicographic resources that takes into account the diverse range of factors and considerations discussed above. By establishing clear criteria and parameters, this system aims to bring order and coherence to the complex landscape of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography, providing a useful framework for researchers, practitioners, and users alike. At the same time, this paper acknowledges the need for ongoing research and reflection in this field, as new technologies, languages, and language varieties continue to emerge and shape the practice of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography."

            "The proposed classification system would begin with a foundational level that considers the basic functionality of the electronic lexicographic resources. This level would include categories such as translation dictionaries, language learning dictionaries, and specialized dictionaries for various fields. Each category would have specific criteria to ensure that resources are appropriately classified.\n\nThe next level of the classification system would take into account the target audience, as previously mentioned. This level would include subcategories for language learners, language professionals, and the general public. By considering the target audience, users can easily identify resources that meet their specific needs and skill levels.\n\nThe third level of the classification system would address the role of artificial intelligence and natural language processing. This level would include subcategories for resources that utilize machine learning algorithms, automated translation, text analysis, and language modeling. By highlighting these technologies, the classification system recognizes the importance of staying up-to-date with the latest developments in the field and provides users with a clear understanding of the capabilities of each resource.\n\nThe final level of the classification system would focus on standardization and norms. This level would include subcategories for resources that adhere to specific standards and guidelines for content and metadata. By emphasizing the importance of standardization, the classification system promotes consistency and accuracy across electronic lexicographic resources, which in turn enhances their discoverability and accessibility.\n\nIn order to implement this classification system, it would be necessary to establish a committee of experts in the field of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography. This committee would be responsible for developing the criteria and parameters for each level and subcategory, as well as for ongoing research and reflection to ensure that the system remains relevant and up-to-date.\n\nIn summary, a comprehensive classification system for electronic lexicographic resources must consider a variety of factors, including basic functionality, target audience, artificial intelligence and natural language processing, and standardization and norms. By establishing clear criteria and parameters, this system will provide a valuable framework for researchers, practitioners, and users alike, promoting consistency, accuracy, and discoverability in the field of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography."

        [
            "The establishment of this committee would be just the beginning of a larger implementation process. Once the criteria and parameters have been set, it would be necessary to apply them to existing electronic lexicographic resources in order to properly categorize and index them. This task would likely require the work of a dedicated team of specialists, who would review and classify each resource according to the new system.\n\nTo ensure the long-term success of the classification system, it would also be important to promote its use and adoption within the community of multilingual and plurilingual lexicographers. This could be achieved through outreach and education efforts, such as workshops, training sessions, and online resources. By raising awareness of the benefits of the classification system, the committee can encourage its use and help to establish it as a standard within the field.\n\nIn addition to its benefits for researchers and practitioners, the classification system can also provide valuable tools and resources for users of electronic lexicographic resources. By making it easier for users to find and access the resources that meet their specific needs and skill levels, the system can help to promote language learning, communication, and cross-cultural understanding.\n\nOverall, the development and implementation of a comprehensive classification system for electronic lexicographic resources is a complex and ongoing process. However, the potential benefits of such a system make it a worthwhile endeavor, and one that has the potential to significantly advance the field of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography."

            "Of course, in order to create a truly effective and comprehensive system, it will be necessary to gather input and feedback from a diverse range of stakeholders. This includes not only lexicographers and linguists, but also educators, language learners, and technology developers. By involving these groups in the development process, the committee can ensure that the final system is both practical and relevant to the needs of its users.\n\nOnce the system is in place, it will also be important to regularly review and update it to ensure that it remains current and relevant. This may involve tracking changes in electronic lexicographic resources and user needs, as well as staying up-to-date with advances in technology and language learning research. By staying proactive and adaptable, the committee can help to ensure that the classification system continues to meet the needs of its users and advances the field of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography.\n\nIn conclusion, the establishment of a comprehensive classification system for electronic lexicographic resources is a complex and ongoing process, but one that has the potential to significantly advance the field of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography.
