Part of the first, second and third floors of the property were also damaged by the blaze.\"\n\nIn a statement, a Metropolitan Police spokesperson said: \"The cause of the fire is under investigation as it is believed it may have been started deliberately. There have been no arrests.\"\n\nPictures posted on social media showed Metropolitan Police and LFB vehicles at the premises on Sunday evening.\n\nMr Freer has represented the North London constituency since 2010.\n\nHe is parliamentary under-secretary of state for courts and legal services, a junior role in the Ministry of Justice.\n\nPictures show the fire spread to an office inside the building",

I immediately called the emergency services and tried to keep a safe distance,\" he said.\n\nThe incident has been condemned by local politicians, including Labour's Shadow Justice Secretary David Lammy who tweeted: \"I'm shocked by this news and my thoughts are with Mike Freer and his team. I hope no one has been hurt and that the fire is contained quickly.\"\n\nThe incident comes just weeks after another Conservative MP, Sir David Amess, was stabbed to death while meeting constituents in Essex. The attack on Mr Freer's office has not been linked to any political motive at this stage.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police have urged anyone with information about the fire to come forward. \"We are keen to hear from anyone who was in the area at the time or who may have footage of the incident,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nIn the meantime, Mr Freer has expressed his gratitude to the emergency services for their quick response. \"I am deeply grateful to the firefighters and police officers who attended the scene so promptly and ensured the fire was brought under control quickly,\" he said.\n\nIt is not yet clear when Mr Freer's office will be able to reopen, but he has urged constituents to continue contacting him via his website or social media channels. \"My team and I remain committed to serving the people of North London and will continue to do so despite this unfortunate incident,\" he said."

Many have also taken to social media to express their support for the MP and his team, using the hashtag #StandWithMikeFreer.\n\nThe incident has sparked a conversation about the safety of politicians and public figures, with many calling for increased security measures to protect them from harm. Some have also pointed to the rise in political tensions and hate crimes in recent years, and the need for leaders to take a stand against divisive rhetoric and actions.\n\nDespite the challenges, Mr. Freer has remained positive and focused on serving his constituents. In a statement, he said, \"I want to assure my constituents that I will continue to work hard for them, and that this incident will not deter me from my commitment to public service.

The police have appealed to the public for any information that could assist with their investigation, and have set up a dedicated tip line for any witnesses to come forward.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Freer's team has been working around the clock to ensure that constituent services are not disrupted. They have set up a temporary office in a nearby community center, and have been working diligently to respond to emails, phone calls, and social media messages. Mr. Freer has also been using virtual platforms to hold meetings and engage with his constituents.\n\nThe fire has also brought attention to the issue of fire safety in older buildings, and has prompted calls for mandatory inspections and upgrades to ensure that they meet modern safety standards. Some have pointed to the cost and logistical challenges of making these upgrades, but others argue that the safety of building occupants should be the top priority.\n\nThrough it all, Mr. Freer has remained committed to his duty to serve his constituents, and has been heartened by the outpouring of support from the community.

The resilience of the community has been truly inspiring, and Mr. Freer is grateful for every act of kindness.\n\nIn the wake of the fire, Mr. Freer has also been advocating for increased funding for fire departments and fire safety education. He believes that it is crucial for local governments to prioritize fire safety and provide the necessary resources to protect their communities. Mr. Freer has been working with other elected officials and fire department leaders to develop a comprehensive plan to improve fire safety in the community.\n\nThe investigation into the fire is still ongoing, but progress is being made every day.

The local fire department has even offered free fire safety inspections and educational resources to residents, encouraging them to take proactive steps to protect their homes and loved ones.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Freer has been hosting town hall meetings to hear directly from his constituents about their concerns and ideas for improving fire safety in the community. These meetings have been well-attended, with residents sharing their personal experiences and suggestions for making their neighborhoods safer. Mr. Freer has been taking note of these ideas and working to incorporate them into the comprehensive fire safety plan.\n\nDespite the ongoing investigation and the challenges of rebuilding, Mr. Freer remains optimistic about the future of the community.

This intergenerational approach to fire safety has ensured that every member of the community is engaged and informed.\n\nIn addition to the fire safety measures, Mr. Freer has also been working on securing funding for the rebuilding of the affected areas.

By investing in the growth and development of its members, the movement can create a strong and informed base that is capable of leading and sustaining the work.\n\nIn addition to education and training, the movement must also prioritize self-care and wellness for its members. Activism and organizing can be emotionally and physically taxing, and it is important for members to have access to resources and support to help them cope with the stress and challenges of this work. This can include things like mental health services, peer support groups, and opportunities for rest and relaxation.\n\nAnother key aspect of building a successful movement is the ability to communicate effectively and transparently with its members and the broader public. This means having clear and consistent messaging, as well as utilizing a variety of communication channels to reach different audiences. The movement must also be open to feedback and criticism, and be willing to engage in dialogue and discussion with those who have differing viewpoints.\n\nFinally, the movement must be committed to holding itself and its members accountable to its values and principles. This can be done through the implementation of clear and transparent decision-making processes, as well as the establishment of mechanisms for addressing and rectifying any harm or wrongdoing that may occur within the movement.\n\nBy prioritizing these key elements, the movement can create a strong and resilient culture that is capable of driving real and lasting change. Through intentional and inclusive practices, the movement can build a powerful force for good that is equipped to tackle the complex and interconnected challenges of our time."
