Part of the first, second and third floors of the property were also damaged by the blaze.\"\n\nIn a statement, a Metropolitan Police spokesperson said: \"The cause of the fire is under investigation as it is believed it may have been started deliberately. There have been no arrests.\"\n\nPictures posted on social media showed Metropolitan Police and LFB vehicles at the premises on Sunday evening.\n\nMr Freer has represented the North London constituency since 2010.\n\nHe is parliamentary under-secretary of state for courts and legal services, a junior role in the Ministry of Justice.\n\nPictures show the fire spread to an office inside the building",

I looked outside and saw flames coming from the back of the building. I called the emergency services immediately.\"\n\nThe incident has caused concern among local residents and politicians, with many condemning the attack and expressing their support for Mr. Freer. The leader of the opposition, Sir Keir Starmer, tweeted, \"Absolutely shocking news. I sincerely hope that Mr. Freer and his staff are safe and well. An attack on a politician's office is an attack on our democracy, and it must be condemned in the strongest terms.\"\n\nLocal Conservative councillor, Chris Huhne, added, \"This is a despicable act of violence and intimidation. Our thoughts are with Mr. Freer and his team, and we hope that those responsible are brought to justice.\"\n\nThe police have appealed for any witnesses to come forward and have urged anyone with information about the incident to contact them. They have also increased patrols in the area to reassure local residents and businesses.\n\nThe cause of the fire is still under investigation, and it is not yet clear whether it was a targeted attack or a random incident. However, the fact that it occurred on Christmas Eve, when the office was likely to be closed, has led some to speculate that it may have been a deliberate attempt to cause damage or disruption.\n\nMr. Freer has released a statement saying that he is \"shocked and saddened\" by the incident but that he is grateful for the swift response of the emergency services. He added, \"This is a difficult time for everyone, and I would urge anyone with information about the fire to come forward and help the police with their investigation.\""
