It all started when Samantha caught Olivia trying on her leather jacket and sunglasses. Olivia had always been fascinated by Samantha's edgy style, but Samantha couldn't help but feel a thrill at the sight of her friend dressed in her clothes.\n\nSamantha jokingly asked Olivia if she was trying to steal her look, but deep down, she was intrigued.
