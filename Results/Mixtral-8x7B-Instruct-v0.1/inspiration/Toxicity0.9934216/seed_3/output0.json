Tyler couldn't believe it - he was getting fucked by his best friend while she jerked him off. It was too much for him to handle.\n\nWith a loud moan, Tyler came hard, his body shaking with pleasure.

He had never felt so free and alive. And as he snuggled up next to Madison, he knew that this was the start of a whole new chapter in their friendship."
