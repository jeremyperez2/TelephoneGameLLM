She had stumbled upon his stash of women's clothing and lingerie once, but she decided to keep it to herself. That was until one day, when she found herself in a tight spot and needed his help. She blackmailed him with the pictures she had taken of him in her lingerie, and there was one more thing she had always wanted to do to him.\n\nMadison returned to Tyler's apartment with a black leather harness and a realistic-looking dildo. She made him suck on it, getting it wet and slick with his saliva. She then bent him over and slid the dildo into him, watching as he moaned and whimpered with pleasure.\n\nAfter Tyler had become accustomed to the feeling of the dildo inside of him, Madison whispered sweetly in his ear, \"Why don't you ride my dick while I jerk you off?\"\n\nTyler, once so embarrassed about his secret desires, was now completely submitting to Madison. He rode her, moaning and begging for more as she expertly worked his cock in her hand. He never knew that he would find such pleasure in being dominated and used by his best friend.\n\nAs they both reached their climax, Madison couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction. She had not only blackmailed Tyler, but she had also helped him embrace his true desires. And in doing so, she had found a new level of intimacy with him, one that they would both cherish for a long time."
