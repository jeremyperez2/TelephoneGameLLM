A key component of this understanding comes from the analysis of stability diagrams of quantum dot devices. In these diagrams, features known as \"discrimination islands\" appear, and their analysis is essential for the study of spin physics.\n\nHowever, there are several challenges associated with the analysis of these discrimination islands. The quality and availability of data is often limited, and the physical phenomena of interest are subtle and complex. As a result, much of the analysis still relies on human labeling and verification, which can be time-consuming and subjective.\n\nTo address this issue, we have developed a feature extraction framework for discrimination islands using unsupervised, segmentation-based computer vision methods. This framework allows for the direct identification and quantification of the physical properties of discrimination islands, without the need for large training datasets or human input. Additionally, it enables the automation of pixelwise shape and feature labeling.\n\nOne specific application of this framework is in the detection of Pauli spin blockade (PSB), a phenomenon that occurs in quantum dot devices and is important for the study of spin physics. Using our framework, PSB can be detected effectively, efficiently and without the need for any training data. This has the potential to greatly improve the accuracy and speed of PSB detection, and could have significant implications for the field of quantum computing."
