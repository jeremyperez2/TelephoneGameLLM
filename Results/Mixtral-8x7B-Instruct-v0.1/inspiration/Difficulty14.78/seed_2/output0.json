NLPMs provide a significant advantage in minimizing energy consumption and processing time, with the potential to reduce the processing power required for training by up to 50%.\n\nThis study offers an experimental analysis of traditional language models and NLPMs, comparing their respective errors and language comprehension capabilities across three popular datasets: the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) corpus, the SuperGLUE benchmark, and a curated dataset of social media texts. Our research also investigates the impact of Neuromorphic Data Generation (NDG) on NLPMs, a technique that involves generating additional training data based on original inputs using principles of neuromorphic computing.\n\nSurprisingly, our findings indicate that the implementation of NDG did not result in a substantial improvement in NLPMs' performance. To further explore this outcome, we examine potential reasons behind the limited effectiveness of NDG and its implications for neuromorphic machine learning theory. Our goal is to stimulate further inquiry into the vast potential of neuromorphic computing in natural language processing technology and uncover new ways to optimize neuromorphic-based models for enhanced language understanding capabilities."
