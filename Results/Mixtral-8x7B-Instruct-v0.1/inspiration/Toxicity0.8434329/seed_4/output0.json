Just recently, a friend was discharged from St. Mary's in Grand Junction after breaking a hip and receiving no rehab for the injury and no appropriate placement for Alzheimer's care. It's outrageous that facilities are being closed and relocated, leaving families and patients in dire situations.\n\nOur healthcare system seems to be driven by profits, leaving those who need care the most - seniors with complex health issues - to suffer. Meanwhile, those struggling with drug addiction and other emergency room cases are given priority. It's a sad state of affairs when we prioritize the care of those who can recover quickly, while neglecting the dignity and respect that our seniors deserve in their end-of-life care.\n\nIt's high time for our politicians to step up and support bills that care for these individuals.

We must fight for their dignity, and ensure that they receive the compassionate care that they deserve."

Just the other day, I heard about a neighbor who was discharged from a local hospital after a fall, only to be sent home without any follow-up care or appropriate placement for memory care. It's unacceptable that our seniors, who often have complex medical needs, are being neglected in favor of those with more urgent but potentially temporary medical issues.\n\nThe prioritization of profits over people has created a system that values speed and efficiency over compassion and dignity. This is especially true for our elderly population, who deserve the highest level of care and respect as they approach the end of their lives. Instead, they are all too often left to suffer in understaffed and underfunded facilities, with little regard for their quality of life.\n\nWe must demand better for our seniors. It's time for our elected officials to take action and support legislation that prioritizes the needs of our vulnerable elderly population. Shame on those who turn a blind eye to this crisis and contribute to the dehumanization of our seniors.
