Traditional optical neural networks (ONNs) utilize light amplitudes at the input and output, but neglect the valuable information contained in light phases. This limitation inspired the creation of Oplixnet, a framework that encodes input image data into both amplitude and phase parts of light signals, and redesigns the input and output components of ONNs to fully leverage this information. Oplixnet also incorporates mutual learning across various ONN structures to maintain accuracy. Experimental results show that Oplixnet significantly reduces the areas of ONNs while keeping the accuracy within an acceptable range. For example, a 75.03% reduction in area was achieved with only a 0.33% accuracy decrease in a fully connected neural network (FCNN), and a 74.88% reduction in area was observed with a 2.38% accuracy decrease in Resnet-32.
