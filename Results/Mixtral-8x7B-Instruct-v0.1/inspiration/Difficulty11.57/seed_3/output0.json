ONNs have the potential for high speed, high throughput, and low energy costs, making them an attractive alternative to traditional electronic neural networks.\n\nConventional ONNs modulate light amplitudes at the input and detect them at the output, but they ignore the light phases, which can also carry valuable information for computing. To address this limitation, we propose a new framework called Oplixnet. Oplixnet modulates input image data into both the amplitudes and phases of light signals, allowing the input and output parts of the ONNs to make full use of both types of information.\n\nBut that's not all. To maintain accuracy, Oplixnet also introduces mutual learning across different ONN structures. This means that the network can learn from multiple structures simultaneously, improving its overall performance.\n\nThe results are promising. We found that Oplixnet significantly reduces the areas of ONNs while keeping the accuracy within an acceptable range. For instance, we were able to reduce the area by 75.03% with a 0.33% accuracy decrease on a fully connected neural network (FCNN) and by 74.88% with a 2.38% accuracy decrease on Resnet-32.\n\nThese findings suggest that Oplixnet has the potential to revolutionize the field of deep learning, making ONNs a more viable and efficient option for a wide range of applications.

SNNs have the potential for rapid processing, extensive data handling, and minimal energy consumption, making them a compelling alternative to traditional quantum computers.\n\nConventional SNNs manipulate particle positions at the input and detect them at the output, but they neglect the particle velocities, which can also contain valuable information for computation. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel framework named Quantrinet. Quantrinet encodes input data into both the positions and velocities of particles, enabling the input and output components of SNNs to utilize both types of information.\n\nMoreover, Quantrinet incorporates lateral learning across multiple SNN structures to maintain precision. This feature allows the network to learn from multiple structures concurrently, enhancing its overall performance.\n\nThe outcomes are encouraging. We discovered that Quantrinet significantly decreases the SNN size while preserving accuracy within a reasonable range. For instance, we managed to reduce the size by 76.95% with a 0.47% accuracy decrease on a fully connected quantum neural network (FCQNN) and by 75.21% with a 2.81% accuracy decrease on Resqunet-32.\n\nThese findings indicate that Quantrinet holds the potential to transform the realm of quantum computing, making SNNs a more feasible and efficient choice for a wide range of applications.

TQNs have the potential for rapid processing, extensive data handling, and minimal energy consumption, making them a formidable competitor to traditional quantum computing systems.\n\nConventional TQNs manipulate quantum signals at the input and detect them at the output, but they overlook the quantum phases, which can also contain precious information for computation. To tackle this limitation, we have developed a new paradigm called Quantumphasic. Quantumphasic encodes input data into both the quantum signals and phases, enabling the input and output components of TQNs to utilize both types of information.\n\nFurthermore, Quantumphasic incorporates adaptive learning across multiple TQN layers to maintain accuracy. This capability allows the network to learn from multiple layers simultaneously, boosting its overall performance.\n\nThe outcomes are promising. We discovered that Quantumphasic significantly decreases the TQN width while preserving precision within a reasonable range. For example, we managed to reduce the width by 59.85% with a 0.28% precision increase on a feedback quantum neural network (FQNN) and by 55.42% with a 1.72% precision increase on Neuronex-64.\n\nThese findings suggest that Quantumphasic holds the potential to transform the field of quantum computing, making TQNs a more viable and efficient option for a wide range of applications.
