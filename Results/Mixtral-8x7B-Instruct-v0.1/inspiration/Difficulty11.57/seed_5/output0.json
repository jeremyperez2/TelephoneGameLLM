Traditional ONNs focus on modulating light amplitudes at the input and detecting them at the output, but they overlook the potential of light phases, which can also carry valuable information for computing.\n\nIntroducing Oplixnet, a novel framework designed to optimize ONNs by encoding input image data into both the amplitudes and phases of light signals. By redesigning the input and output components of ONNs, Oplixnet fully utilizes the potential of both amplitude and phase information.
