Traditional optical neural networks (ONNs) have primarily focused on modulating light amplitudes at the input and detecting them at the output, while disregarding the valuable information contained in light phases.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a novel framework, named OptiPhase, that takes advantage of both the amplitude and phase components of light signals to compress the areas of ONNs, thereby increasing their computational efficiency. By encoding input image data into both the amplitude and phase parts of light signals, OptiPhase enhances the input and output parts of the ONNs to fully utilize the information-carrying capacity of light.\n\nTo ensure the accuracy of the computation, OptiPhase incorporates mutual learning across different ONN structures. This feature allows the network to maintain high accuracy levels even as it compresses the areas of the network. Our experimental results demonstrate that OptiPhase significantly reduces the areas of ONNs, with minimal impact on the accuracy of the computation.\n\nFor instance, we achieved a 75.03% reduction in the area of a fully connected neural network (FCNN) with only a 0.33% decrease in accuracy. Similarly, we achieved a 74.88% reduction in the area of a ResNet-32 network with just a 2.38% decrease in accuracy.
