The office of the North London area MP, a member of the Conservative party, had been targeted in the late hours of a holiday evening.\n\nUpon discovery of the blaze, which is believed to have started in a shed behind the building, the Metropolitan Police and London Fire Brigade were quickly on the scene.

Fortunately, the office had been unoccupied at the time of the incident, and there were no reported injuries.\n\nThe MP, who has represented the North London constituency since 2010 and currently serves as the parliamentary under-secretary of state for courts and legal services, expressed gratitude for the rapid response of the emergency services. He stated that the fire had caused significant damage to the office, but that the police and fire brigade had been \"incredible\" in their efforts.\n\nAs the cause of the fire is still under investigation, no arrests have been made.
