So, they sent out invitations to all the kingdoms, inviting all the eligible princesses to come and meet their son.\n\n#3\n\nOne day, a young and beautiful princess named Snow White arrived at the castle. She was the fairest of them all, and the king and queen were immediately taken with her.\n\n#4\n\nBut as soon as they saw her, they knew that she was not the right princess for their son. They were not sure why, but they just knew that she was not the one.\n\n#5\n\nSo, they decided to send her away.

There were other princesses who had been rejected by the king and queen. They all felt the same way that Snow White did.\n\n#8\n\nAnd so, they all decided to form a club. They called it the Rejected Princess Club.\n\n#9\n\nThe Rejected Princess Club was a place where they could all come and share their stories and their feelings. They could talk about how they had been rejected and how they felt about it.\n\n#10\n\nAnd they could also talk about their hopes and dreams. They could talk about what they wanted to do with their lives.\n\n#11\n\nThe Rejected Princess Club was a place where they could all be themselves.
