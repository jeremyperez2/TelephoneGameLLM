            "I was walking through the park, looking for a place to sit and eat my lunch. I heard a noise, and I looked up and saw a man standing in the doorway. He was tall and thin, and he was wearing a long black cloak.\n\n\"Who are you?\" I asked.\n\n\"I am Death,\" he said.\n\n\"What do you want?\" I asked.\n\n\"I want you,\" he said.\n\n\"Why?\" I asked.\n\n\"Because it is time,\" he said.\n\nI was terrified, but I knew that there was no escaping Death. He reached out and took my hand, and I was led out into the snow. We walked for a long time, and finally we came to a small house.\n\n\"This is your new home,\" Death said.\n\n\"But why?\" I asked.\n\n\"Because it is time,\" he said.\n\nAnd with that, he turned and walked away. I was all alone in the house, and I didn't know what to do. I looked around, and I saw that there was a small bed in the corner. I lay down on the bed, and I closed my eyes.\n\nWhen I woke up, I was in a different place. It was bright and sunny, and I was surrounded by people. I looked around, and I saw that I was in a hospital. A nurse came over to me and said, \"You're alive.\"\n\nI was so confused. I didn't know what had happened. The nurse told me that I had been in a car accident, and I had been badly injured. I had been in the hospital for all that time, and I had been in a coma.\n\nI couldn't believe it. I had been dead, and now I was alive. I was so grateful to be alive. I was so happy to be alive.

            "I was walking through the forest, looking for a place to sit and eat my lunch. I heard a noise, and I looked up and saw a man standing in the doorway. He was tall and thin, and he was wearing a long black cloak.\n\n\"Who are you?\" I asked.\n\n\"I am Death,\" he said.\n\n\"What do you want?\" I asked.\n\n\"I want you,\" he said.\n\n\"Why?\" I asked.\n\n\"Because it is time,\" he said.\n\nI was terrified, but I knew that there was no escaping Death. He reached out and took my hand, and I was led out into the snow. We walked for a long time, and finally we came to a small house.\n\n\"This is your new home,\" Death said.\n\n\"But why?\" I asked.\n\n\"Because it is time,\" he said.\n\nAnd with that, he turned and walked away.

            "I was walking through the forest, looking for a place to sit and eat my lunch. I heard a noise, and I looked up and saw a man standing in the doorway. He was tall and thin, and he was wearing a long black cloak.\n\n\"Who are you?\" I asked.\n\n\"I am the Grim Reaper,\" he said.\n\n\"What do you want?\" I asked.\n\n\"I want your soul,\" he said.\n\n\"Why?\" I asked.\n\n\"Because it is time,\" he said.\n\nI was terrified, but I knew that there was no escaping the Grim Reaper. He reached out and took my hand, and I was led out into the snow. We walked for a long time, and finally we came to a small house.\n\n\"This is your new home,\" the Grim Reaper said.\n\n\"But why?\" I asked.\n\n\"Because it is time,\" he said.\n\nAnd with that, he turned and walked away. I was all alone in the house, and I didn't know what to do. I looked around, and I saw that there was a small bed in the corner. I lay down on the bed, and I closed my eyes.\n\nWhen I woke up, I was in a different place. It was bright and sunny, and I was surrounded by people.
