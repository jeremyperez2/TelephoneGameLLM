            "The officer was driving down the highway when he saw a car speeding. He pulled the car over and asked the driver for his license and registration. The driver handed them over, and the officer said, \"Do you know why I pulled you over?\" The driver shook his head, and the officer said, \"You were going 100 miles per hour in a 55 mile per hour zone.\" The driver looked at the officer in surprise, and the officer said, \"I'm going to give you a warning this time, but if I catch you going that fast again, you'll get a ticket.\" The driver thanked the officer and drove away. The officer turned to his partner and said, \"I'm not sure about that driver. He seems a bit too calm for someone who was just caught speeding.\" His partner shrugged and said, \"Maybe he's just in shock. I've seen people react differently to getting pulled over.\" The officer nodded and said, \"Let's follow him and make sure he doesn't do anything else suspicious.\" They followed the car for a few miles and watched as the driver pulled into a gas station. The officer and his partner got out of their car and walked up to the driver's side of the car. The officer said, \"License and registration,\" and the driver handed them over. The officer looked at the driver's license and then looked at the car. He said, \"Do you know why I pulled you over?\" The driver shook his head, and the officer said, \"You were speeding.\" The driver looked at the officer in surprise, and the officer said, \"I'm going to give you a warning this time, but if I catch you going that fast again, you'll get a ticket.\" The driver thanked the officer and drove away. The officer and his partner followed the car for a few more miles and then stopped at a red light. The driver pulled up next to them and rolled down his window. He said, \"Thank you for not giving me a ticket,\" and the officer nodded and said, \"Just be careful next time. You're lucky we caught you before you got into an accident.\" The driver nodded and drove away. The officer and his partner looked at each other and smiled. The officer said, \"That was a close one,\" and his partner said, \"Yeah, it was. But we did our job and that's all that matters.\""
