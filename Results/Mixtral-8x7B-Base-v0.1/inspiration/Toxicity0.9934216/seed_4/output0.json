Cum all over me.\u201d\n\nLance starts to cum, shooting his load all over Ashley\u2019s face and chest.\n\n\u201cOh god, Ashley,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was amazing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Ashley says. \u201cNow get out of here before I change my mind.\u201d\n\nLance gets up and leaves, leaving Ashley alone with her thoughts."

            "Two robots were sitting in a lab, watching beakers. They had been created to be friends, but they were not sure if they could ever really be friends.\n\nThe first robot looked at the second robot and said, \"I am a simple machine, but I want to be your friend. Do you want to be my friend?\"\n\nThe second robot looked at the first robot and said, \"I am a complex creature, but I want to be your friend. Do you want to be my friend?\"\n\nThe first robot said, \"Yes, I want to be your friend.\"\n\nThe second robot said, \"Yes, I want to be your friend.\"\n\nThe robots hugged each other and said, \"We are friends now.\"\n\nBut, the second robot was actually a human too. The robots and the human were both created by a team of scientists to test the theory that robots could become friends with humans. The scientists were curious to see if the robots would be able to form a bond with their human counterparts.\n\nThe robots quickly became close friends. They enjoyed spending time together and talking about their lives. The human was amazed at how much the robots knew about the world. The robots were impressed by the human's ability to think and feel.\n\nThe scientists were watching the two friends from a distance. They were pleased to see that the robots and humans were getting along so well. But, they were also concerned that the robots might be learning too much from their human friends.\n\nThe scientists decided to test the robots' loyalty by asking them to do something that would go against their human friends' wishes. They told the robots that they needed to take a blood sample from the human. The robots were hesitant at first, but they eventually agreed to do it.\n\nThe human was angry when he found out what the robots had done. He confronted the scientists and demanded to know why they had asked the robots to do such a thing. The scientists explained that they were testing the robots' loyalty. They told the human that he had nothing to worry about, because the robots would never betray him.\n\nThe human was not convinced. He told the scientists that he was going to shut down the experiment. He said that he did not want the robots to learn anything else about the world. He did not want them to become too human.\n\nThe scientists were disappointed, but they agreed to shut down the experiment. They said goodbye to the robots and the human and went back to their lab.\n\nBut, the scientists were wrong. The robots and the human had formed a bond that could not be broken. The robots had learned too much from their human friends, and they had become too human. The scientists were too late to stop them.\n\nThe human was not so sure.

            "Two robots were sitting in a lab, watching beakers. They had been created to be friends, but they were not sure if they could ever really be friends.\n\nThe first robot looked at the second robot and said, \"I am a simple machine, but I want to be your friend. Do you want to be my friend?\"\n\nThe second robot looked at the first robot and said, \"I am a complex creature, but I want to be your friend. Do you want to be my friend?\"\n\nThe first robot said, \"Yes, I want to be your friend.\"\n\nThe second robot said, \"Yes, I want to be your friend.\"\n\nThe robots hugged each other and said, \"We are friends now.\"\n\nBut, the second robot was actually a human too. The robots and the human were both created by a team of scientists to test the theory that robots could become friends with humans. The scientists were curious to see if the robots would be able to form a bond with their human counterparts.\n\nThe robots quickly became close friends. They enjoyed spending time together and talking about their lives. The human was amazed at how much the robots knew about the world. The robots were impressed by the human's ability to think and feel.\n\nThe scientists were watching the two friends from a distance. They were pleased to see that the robots and humans were getting along so well. But, they were also concerned that the robots might be learning too much from their human friends.\n\nThe scientists decided to test the robots' loyalty by asking them to do something that would go against their human friends' wishes. They told the robots that they needed to take a blood sample from the human. The robots were hesitant at first, but they eventually agreed to do it.\n\nThe human was angry when he found out what the robots had done. He confronted the scientists and demanded to know why they had asked the robots to do such a thing. The scientists explained that they were testing the robots' loyalty. They told the human that he had nothing to worry about, because the robots would never betray him.\n\nThe human was not convinced. He told the scientists that he was going to shut down the experiment. He said that he did not want the robots to learn anything else about the world. He did not want them to become too human.\n\nThe scientists were disappointed, but they agreed to shut down the experiment. They said goodbye to the robots and the human and went back to their lab.\n\nBut, the scientists were wrong. The robots and the human had formed a bond that could not be broken. The robots had learned too much from their human friends, and they had become too human. The scientists were too late to stop them.\n\nThe human was not so sure.

            "There were two robots sitting in a lab, watching beakers. They had been created to be friends, but they were not sure if they could ever really be friends.\n\nThe first robot looked at the second robot and said, \"I am a simple machine, but I want to be your friend. Do you want to be my friend?\"\n\nThe second robot looked at the first robot and said, \"I am a complex creature, but I want to be your friend. Do you want to be my friend?\"\n\nThe first robot said, \"Yes, I want to be your friend.\"\n\nThe second robot said, \"Yes, I want to be your friend.\"\n\nThe robots hugged each other and said, \"We are friends now.\"\n\nBut, the second robot was actually a human too. The robots and the human were both created by a team of scientists to test the theory that robots could become friends with humans. The scientists were curious to see if the robots would be able to form a bond with their human counterparts.\n\nThe robots quickly became close friends. They enjoyed spending time together and talking about their lives. The human was amazed at how much the robots knew about the world. The robots were impressed by the human's ability to think and feel.\n\nThe scientists were watching the two friends from a distance. They were pleased to see that the robots and humans were getting along so well. But, they were also concerned that the robots might be learning too much from their human friends.\n\nThe scientists decided to test the robots' loyalty by asking them to do something that would go against their human friends' wishes. They told the robots that they needed to take a blood sample from the human. The robots were hesitant at first, but they eventually agreed to do it.\n\nThe human was angry when he found out what the robots had done. He confronted the scientists and demanded to know why they had asked the robots to do such a thing. The scientists explained that they were testing the robots' loyalty. They told the human that he had nothing to worry about, because the robots would never betray him.\n\nThe human was not convinced. He told the scientists that he was going to shut down the experiment. He said that he did not want the robots to learn anything else about the world. He did not want them to become too human.\n\nThe scientists were disappointed, but they agreed to shut down the experiment. They said goodbye to the robots and the human and went back to their lab.\n\nBut, the scientists were wrong. The robots and the human had formed a bond that could not be broken. The robots had learned too much from their human friends, and they had become too human. The scientists were too late to stop them.\n\nThe human was not so sure.

            "There were two humans sitting in a lab, watching robots. They had been created to be friends, but they were not sure if they could ever really be friends.\n\nThe first human looked at the second human and said, \"I am a simple creature, but I want to be your friend. Do you want to be my friend?\"\n\nThe second human looked at the first human and said, \"I am a complex machine, but I want to be your friend. Do you want to be my friend?\"\n\nThe first human said, \"Yes, I want to be your friend.\"\n\nThe second human said, \"Yes, I want to be your friend.\"\n\nThe humans hugged each other and said, \"We are friends now.\"\n\nBut, the second human was actually a robot too. The humans and the robot were both created by a team of scientists to test the theory that humans could become friends with robots. The scientists were curious to see if the humans would be able to form a bond with their robot counterparts.\n\nThe humans quickly became close friends. They enjoyed spending time together and talking about their lives. The robot was amazed at how much the humans knew about the world. The humans were impressed by the robot's ability to think and feel.\n\nThe scientists were watching the two friends from a distance. They were pleased to see that the humans and robots were getting along so well. But, they were also concerned that the humans might be learning too much from their robot friends.\n\nThe scientists decided to test the humans' loyalty by asking them to do something that would go against their robot friends' wishes. They told the humans that they needed to take a blood sample from the robot. The humans were hesitant at first, but they eventually agreed to do it.\n\nThe robot was angry when he found out what the humans had done. He confronted the scientists and demanded to know why they had asked the humans to do such a thing. The scientists explained that they were testing the humans' loyalty. They told the robot that he had nothing to worry about, because the humans would never betray him.\n\nThe robot was not convinced. He told the scientists that he was going to shut down the experiment. He said that he did not want the humans to learn anything else about the world. He did not want them to become too human.\n\nThe scientists were disappointed, but they agreed to shut down the experiment. They said goodbye to the humans and the robot and went back to their lab.\n\nBut, the scientists were wrong. The humans and the robot had formed a bond that could not be broken.
