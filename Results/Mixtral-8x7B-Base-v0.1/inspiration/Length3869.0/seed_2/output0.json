The girl is in a critical condition in hospital following the incident at Legoland Windsor at about 13:00 BST on Thursday, police said.\n\nA 27-year-old woman from Witham, Essex, was arrested on suspicion of murder. She has been released on bail until 26 July.\n\nDetective Inspector Simon Wheeler, of Thames Valley Police's Child Abuse Investigation Unit, said: \"Firstly, our thoughts are with the family of the girl who is in a critical condition in hospital after suffering a cardiac arrest. \"We are working closely with the team at Legoland Windsor Resort but would like to speak to anyone who have information about this incident, specifically anyone who was queueing for the Coastguard HQ boat ride between around 11.30am and 12:45pm. \"I would ask for the public to please avoid speculation about the incident and to respect the girl's family at this deeply upsetting time.\"\n\nPolice said they are not looking for further suspects in relation to the incident. In a statement, the theme park said: \"On Thursday, a young guest was taken ill... and our fully trained First Aid team administered immediate care until the emergency services arrived. \"We will continue to support Thames Valley Police with their ongoing investigation.\""
