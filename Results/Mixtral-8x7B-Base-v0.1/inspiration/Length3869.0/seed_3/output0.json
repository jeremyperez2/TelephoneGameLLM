The baby's heart had stopped beating for good.\n\nThe baby's mother was devastated. She had been playing with her child at the park when the incident occurred. She couldn't understand how this could happen.\n\nThe police were called to the scene. They began to investigate the cause of the baby's death. They interviewed the mother and other witnesses. They searched the area for clues.\n\nBut they found nothing. There were no signs of foul play. It seemed like the baby's heart had just stopped for no reason.\n\nThe mother was taken into custody. She was questioned by detectives. They wanted to know if she had done anything to harm her child.\n\nBut she insisted that she had done nothing wrong.
