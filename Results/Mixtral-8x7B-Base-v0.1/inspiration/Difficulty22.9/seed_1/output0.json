Cerebral palsy is a group of disorders that affect movement and muscle tone or posture. It is caused by abnormal brain development or damage to the developing brain that occurs before, during, or shortly after birth. People with cerebral palsy may have difficulty with walking, balance, coordination, and fine motor skills. They may also have difficulty with communication, learning, and behavior. Treatment for cerebral palsy includes physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, medications, and surgery."

            "The researchers used a single-view camera to capture videos of people with physical disabilities and then used these videos to train and test a proposed framework for estimating their gait parameters. They found that the proposed framework outperformed state-of-the-art approaches and was able to accurately estimate gait parameters such as knee flexion angle, maximum extension, and walking speed.\n\nThe researchers then analyzed the gait parameters of people with physical disabilities and found that these parameters were important for assessing and diagnosing the condition.
