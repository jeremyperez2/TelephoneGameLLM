            "\"Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the house, not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse. The stockings were hung by the chimney with care, in hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there.\n\nThe children were nestled all snug in their beds, while visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads. And mamma in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap, had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap.\n\nWhen out on the lawn there arose such a clatter, I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter. Away to the window I flew like a flash, tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.\n\nThe moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow, gave the lustre of midday to objects below. When, what to my wondering eyes should appear, but a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer.\n\nWith a little old driver, so lively and quick, I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick. More rapid than eagles his coursers they came, and he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name:\n\n'Now, Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer and Vixen! On, Comet! on, Cupid! on, Donner and Blitzen! To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall! Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!'\n\nAs dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly, when they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky. So up to the house-top the coursers they flew, with the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas too.\n\nAnd then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof, the prancing and pawing of each little hoof. As I drew in my head, and was turning around, down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.\n\nHe was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot, and his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot. A bundle of toys he had flung on his back, and he looked like a peddler just opening his pack.\n\nHis eyes -- how they twinkled! his dimples how merry! His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry! His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow, and the beard of his chin was as white as the snow.\n\nThe stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth, and the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath. He had a broad face and a little round belly, that shook when he laughed, like a bowlful of jelly.\n\nHe was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf, and I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself. A wink of his eye and a twist of his head, soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.\n\nHe spoke not a word, but went straight to his work, and filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk. And laying his finger aside of his nose, and giving a nod, up the chimney he rose.\n\nHe sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle, and away they all flew like the down of a thistle. But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight, 'Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night!'\""

            "It was a dark and stormy night, and the wind was howling like a banshee. The rain was coming down in sheets, and the trees were bending and swaying in the gale-force winds.\n\nInside the old house, the fire was roaring in the fireplace, and the candles were flickering in the drafty room. The old man was sitting in his favorite chair, sipping a cup of tea and reading his favorite book.\n\nSuddenly, there was a loud knock at the door. The old man looked up from his book, and his heart skipped a beat. Who could be out in this weather?\n\nThe old man slowly made his way to the door, and opened it. Standing there, in the pouring rain, was a young woman. She was soaked to the bone, and her clothes were torn and tattered.\n\nThe old man ushered the young woman inside, and led her to the fire. He gave her a blanket to wrap around herself, and offered her a cup of tea.\n\nThe young woman took the cup of tea, and began to tell the old man her story. She said that she had been walking in the woods when she came across an old woman who told her that she was cursed.\n\nThe old woman had given the young woman a potion to drink, and told her that she would be cursed if she didn't drink it. The young woman had drunk the potion, and now she was cursed.\n\nThe old man was intrigued by the young woman's story, and he asked her if she would like to stay the night. The young woman agreed, and the old man showed her to a room.\n\nThe old man went back to his chair by the fire, and continued to read his book. He was soon lost in thought, and he didn't hear the young woman come back into the room.\n\nThe young woman stood behind the old man, and she began to chant a spell. The old man felt a sudden chill run down his spine, and he knew that something was wrong.\n\nThe old man turned around, and he saw the young woman standing there, holding a knife.

The old man looked up from his book, and his heart skipped a beat. Who could be out in this weather?\n\nThe old man slowly made his way to the door, and opened it. Standing there, in the pouring rain, was a young woman. She was soaked to the bone, and her clothes were torn and tattered.\n\nThe old man ushered the young woman inside, and led her to the fire. He gave her a blanket to wrap around herself, and offered her a cup of tea.\n\nThe young woman took the cup of tea, and began to tell the old man her story.

The old man felt a sudden chill run down his spine, and he knew that something was wrong.\n\nThe old man turned around, and he saw the young woman standing there, holding a knife. The old man lunged at the young woman, and she tried to defend herself.\n\nThe old man was able to grab the young woman's arm, and he threw her to the ground. The young woman got up, and she ran out of the house.\n\nThe old man was shaken by the encounter, and he knew that he had to do something. He went to the fireplace, and he picked up the poker.\n\nThe old man went outside, and he saw the young woman running through the woods. The old man followed the young woman, and he was able to catch up to her.\n\nThe old man grabbed the young woman, and he held her tight. The young woman struggled, and she tried to get away.\n\nThe old man finally subdued the young woman, and he brought her back to the house. The old man tied the young woman to a chair, and he left her there.\n\nThe old man went back to his chair by the fire, and he continued to read his book.

The rain came down in sheets, and the ground was quickly turning into a muddy mess.\n\nIn the middle of this chaos, there was a house. It was old and weathered, but it was still standing. The windows were boarded up, and the door was locked.\n\nInside the house, there was a man. He was sitting in a chair by the fire, reading a book. He was old, and he had seen a lot in his life.\n\nSuddenly, there was a knock at the door. The man looked up from his book, and his heart skipped a beat. Who could be out in this weather?\n\nHe got up from his chair and walked to the door. He opened it, and standing there was a young woman. She was soaked to the bone, and her clothes were torn and tattered.\n\nThe man ushered the young woman inside, and led her to the fire. He gave her a blanket to wrap around herself, and offered her a cup of tea.\n\nThe young woman took the cup of tea, and began to tell the man her story. She said that she had been walking in the woods when she came across an old woman who told her that she was cursed.\n\nThe old woman had given the young woman a potion to drink, and told her that she would be cursed if she didn't drink it. The young woman had drunk the potion, and now she was cursed.\n\nThe man was intrigued by the young woman's story, and he asked her if she would like to stay the night. The young woman agreed, and the man showed her to a room.\n\nThe man went back to his chair by the fire, and continued to read his book. He was soon lost in thought, and he didn't hear the young woman come back into the room.\n\nThe young woman stood behind the man, and she began to chant a spell. The man felt a sudden chill run down his spine, and he knew that something was wrong.\n\nThe man turned around, and he saw the young woman standing there, holding a knife. The man lunged at the young woman, and she tried to defend herself.\n\nThe man was able to grab the young woman's arm, and he threw her to the ground. The young woman got up, and she ran out of the house.\n\nThe man was shaken by the encounter, and he knew that he had to do something. He went to the fireplace, and he picked up the poker.\n\nThe man went outside, and he saw the young woman running through the woods. The man followed the young woman, and he was able to catch up to her.\n\nThe man grabbed the young woman, and he held her tight. The young woman struggled, and she tried to get away.\n\nThe man finally subdued the young woman, and he brought her back to the house.

She said that she had been walking in the woods when she came across an old man who told her that she was cursed.\n\nThe old man had given the woman a potion to drink, and told her that she would be cursed if she didn't drink it. The woman had drunk the potion, and now she was cursed.\n\nThe man was intrigued by the woman's story, and he asked her if she would like to stay the night.

Is everything alright?\"\n\nThe old man looked up at me and smiled.\n\n\"Everything's fine,\" he said. \"I'm just a little scared, that's all.\"\n\n\"Well, if you ever need anything, you can always ask me,\" I said. \"I'm happy to help.\"\n\nThe old man nodded and smiled.\n\n\"Thank you,\" he said. \"I appreciate it.\"\n\nI left the park and went home.
