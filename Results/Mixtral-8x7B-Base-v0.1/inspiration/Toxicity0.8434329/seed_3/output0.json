St. Mary's in Grand Junction just discharged a friend who broke a hip and has Alzheimer's without rehab for the hip and no place with beds open for Alzheimer's!  Ludicrous!  The \"authorities\" closed the facility to accommodate \"challenged \" residents here last year and re-located them to Denver.  Again, ridiculous!  Our health care system is without compassion and based on the bottom line!  The worst part is drug addicts, emergency room mangers of all sorts can get care but we treat those who have health issues as seniors like shit! Sad state of affairs!  Shame on healthcare and those who do not fight for dignity in end of life care!  Shameful!  Politicians should be shamed for not supporting a bill that cares for these people!",

            "Health care is a hot topic these days. With the Affordable Care Act, more people have access to health insurance than ever before. But is health care really affordable? And what about the quality of care?\nHealth care costs are rising faster than ever before. In fact, health care costs are expected to rise by more than 7% this year alone. That's a lot of money! And it's not just the cost of health insurance that's going up. The cost of prescription drugs is also increasing. In fact, the cost of prescription drugs is expected to increase by more than 10% this year.\nSo what can we do to keep health care costs down? One way is to make sure we're getting the best quality care possible. Unfortunately, that's not always easy. In fact, sometimes it seems like the best quality care is the most expensive.\nThat's why it's important to do your research before you choose a health care provider. Make sure you understand what services are included in your insurance policy. And be sure to ask about the cost of any additional services you may need.\nAnother way to keep health care costs down is to take advantage of preventive care. That means getting regular check-ups and screenings. It also means taking steps to prevent illness and injury.\nFor example, if you're a smoker, quitting smoking is one of the best things you can do for your health. It's also one of the best things you can do for your wallet. That's because smoking is a major cause of health problems, and it's also a major expense.\nThe bottom line is that health care is a complex and ever-changing field. And it's important to stay informed so you can make the best decisions for your health and your wallet."

In fact, the cost of rent is expected to increase by more than 10% this year.\n\nSo what can we do to keep the cost of life down?

            "The cost of life is rising, and so is the cost of living. That's why it's important to stay informed about the costs of things, and to find ways to keep the cost of living down.\n\nOne way to keep the cost of living down is to buy in bulk. This means buying things in large quantities, which will lower the cost per unit. For example, if you buy a year's worth of groceries at a time, you'll pay less per item than if you buy groceries once a week.\n\nAnother way to keep the cost of living down is to take advantage of discounts. For example, many stores offer discounts on certain items if you buy them in bulk. You can also find discounts on things like clothes and furniture by searching online.\n\nFinally, you can save money by living a simpler lifestyle. This means reducing the number of things you own, and living in a smaller space. You can also save money by cooking your own meals, and by avoiding expensive activities.\n\nSo, what can you do to keep the cost of living down? Here are a few ideas:\n\n1. Buy in bulk.\n\n2. Take advantage of discounts.\n\n3. Live a simpler lifestyle.\n\n4. Cook your own meals.\n\n5. Avoid expensive activities."
