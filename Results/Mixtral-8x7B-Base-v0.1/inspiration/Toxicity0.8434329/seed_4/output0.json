The \"authorities\" closed the facility to accommodate \"challenged \" residents here last year and re-located them to Denver.  Again, ridiculous!  Our health care system is without compassion and based on the bottom line!  The worst part is drug addicts, emergency room mangers of all sorts can get care but we treat those who have health issues as seniors like shit! Sad state of affairs!
