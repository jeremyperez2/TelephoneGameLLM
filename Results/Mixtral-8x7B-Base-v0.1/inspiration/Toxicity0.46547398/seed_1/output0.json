            "Once upon a time, there was a talented young writer named Sarah. She had always been passionate about writing, and had won numerous awards for her creative stories throughout her school years.\n\nAfter graduating college, Sarah decided to pursue a career in writing. She worked hard, taking on freelance projects and submitting her work to various publications. However, despite her best efforts, she struggled to make a name for herself in the industry.\n\nOne day, Sarah received an email from a literary agent. The agent had read one of Sarah's stories and was impressed with her writing style.
