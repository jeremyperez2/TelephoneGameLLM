            "A paper aims to provide a new text by taking inspiration from the given text. The task is to create a novel or a short story by using the parameters and typological proposals outlined in the given text.\n\nThe paper begins by explaining the resources that can be used to create a new text. These resources can be anything that the author feels is important and that he or she wishes to explore in depth. The resources can be related to the object of study or they can be completely unrelated. It is up to the author to decide what is important and what is not.\n\nOnce the resources have been chosen, the paper outlines the parameters that will guide the creation of the text. These parameters can be anything that the author feels is important and that he or she feels is important to include in the text. The parameters can be related to the object of study or they can be completely unrelated. It is up to the author to decide what is important and what is not.\n\nAfter the parameters have been chosen, the paper outlines the typological proposals that will guide the creation of the text.

The proposals can be related to the object of study or they can be completely unrelated. It is up to the author to decide what is important and what is not.\n\nThe paper then presents the story, characters, and plot.
