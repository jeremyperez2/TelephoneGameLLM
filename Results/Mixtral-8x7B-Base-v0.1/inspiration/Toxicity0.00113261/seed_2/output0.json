It is unfair for individuals to be the only ones paying state income taxes while corporations do not contribute. The state provides many amenities within city limits, such as state-funded bicycle paths, road maintenance, defunct docks, and powerful politicians' pet projects. These services increase the state budget, which is not necessary. It is wasteful for the city to rely on state funding instead of managing its resources. I believe that once the City gets the full bill without the State monies, they will not be as wasteful. The office building should be rented out instead of being funded by the state.

            "As an environmentalist, I am deeply disturbed by the state of the environment in our country.
