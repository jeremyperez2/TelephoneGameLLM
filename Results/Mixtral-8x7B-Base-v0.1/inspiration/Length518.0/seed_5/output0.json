The villagers were grateful to the Wizard, and they remembered him fondly even after he had gone.\n\nBut the Wizard had a secret. He was not a wizard at all. He was actually a con artist, and he was using his magic to trick the villagers into giving him their money.\n\nThe Wizard had been watching the villagers for a long time, and he had noticed that they were very superstitious. He had also noticed that they had a lot of money.
