He was most recently assigned to the Eighth Army, US Forces Korea at Camp Humphreys in South Korea.\n\nHe did not request official clearance and the defence department did not authorise his travel to China or Russia, the US Army said. There is no evidence he intended to remain in Russia.\n\nThe Russian interior ministry informed the US embassy in Moscow on 3 May that Sgt Black had been arrested a day earlier for theft of personal property.\n\nHe is being held at a pre-trial detention facility until his next hearing.\n\n\"The Army notified his family and the US Department of State is providing appropriate consular support to the Soldier in Russia,\" the US Army said in a statement on Monday.\n\nNational Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters the US is \"aware of this case and other matters related to Russia\".\n\nAt the White House briefing on Monday, Mr Kirby said he could not provide more details.\n\nRussia is holding two other Americans. Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich has been detained since March 2023 on espionage charges.\n\nFormer US Marine Paul Whelan was accused of spying and sentenced to 16 years in prison in 2020.\n\nBoth men maintain their innocence, and the US government says the charges against them are baseless.",

            "According to the United States Army, a US soldier stationed in South Korea was detained by Russia. The Russian foreign ministry stated that the charges against the soldier are not related to politics or espionage, but instead relate to a domestic crime. On May 2nd, the 34-year-old soldier was detained in Vladivostok, located in Russia's Far East region, while he was relocating from South Korea to Fort Cavazos in Texas. The US Army spokeswoman Cynthia Smith stated that the soldier traveled through China to Vladivostok for personal reasons and did not request official clearance or seek authorization from the defense department for his travel to China or Russia. There is no evidence that he intended to remain in Russia. The US Army notified his family and the US Department of State is providing appropriate consular support to the soldier in Russia. The National Security Council spokesman John Kirby stated that the US is aware of this case and other matters related to Russia. At the White House briefing on Monday, Mr Kirby said he could not provide more details."
