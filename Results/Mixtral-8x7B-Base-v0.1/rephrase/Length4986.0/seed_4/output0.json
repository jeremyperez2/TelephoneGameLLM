However, British Election Study data collected at the time did not show any marked swing away from Labour among those who came to believe that Mr Miliband would be willing to do a deal with the SNP.\n\nBut, in any event, how realistic is it to use the share of the vote won by the parties in local elections to anticipate what might happen in an immediate general election? There are certainly two potential difficulties.\n\nAlthough the ups and downs in party performance in local elections often run in parallel with the rises and falls in party support in the polls, some people (around one in five) vote differently in local elections than they would in a general election.\n\nAs a result the divergence between the level of support parties win in a local election and how well they would perform in a general election has become more marked.\n\nNowadays the Liberal Democrats consistently outperform their national standing in the local ballot boxes. The same has also come to be true of the Greens, while independent candidates have also enjoyed some notable success in recent years. Labour, in contrast, often do less well in local elections.\n\nMeanwhile, the party political battle in Scotland is now very different from that in England - and the outcome of the current battle north of the border between Labour and the SNP could be crucial to the result of the next election. English local elections do not tell us much about what will happen north of the border.\n\nThese developments have made discerning the implications of local elections for the outcome of a general election more difficult.\n\nAt the same time, there are two particular features of the results of this year's local elections that make it especially difficult.\n\nFirst, the polls suggest that more people who voted Conservative in 2019 have now switched to Reform than to Labour. But Reform were only on the ballot paper in one in six council wards. So, it may well be the case that people who would vote Reform if there had been a Reform candidate locally stuck with the Tories instead.\n\nCertainly, Conservative support fell more heavily where Reform did stand. In the BBC's sample of key wards the party's support fell by 19 points in these wards - compared with 11 points in wards where Reform did not stand. Labour, in contrast, did rather better where Reform stood.\n\nThat 19-point drop matches the 19-point fall in the average level of Conservative support in the polls since May 2021. That figure may represent a better guide to the Conservatives' immediate prospects in a general election.\n\nSecond, the local election results confirm the message from last year's contests that the geography of party support has changed to the Conservatives' disadvantage.\n\nThe party's support fell more heavily in wards it was trying to defend.\n\nAt the same time, some voters seemingly voted for whichever party was best placed to defeat the Conservatives locally. Labour's support increased most (at the expense of the Liberal Democrats) in wards where they started off second to the Conservatives, while the Liberal Democrats advanced most (and Labour did less well) in wards where were the principal challengers locally.\n\nIndeed, it is these two patterns that help explain why the Conservative Party lost nearly one in two of the council seats it was trying to defend. Conservative MPs would be unwise to assume that the same fate could not also befall them.\n\nSir John Curtice is Professor of Politics, University of Strathclyde, and Senior Fellow, National Centre for Social Research and 'The UK in a Changing Europe'.

            "Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer cautions that he would be supported in Downing Street by the SNP, the Liberal Democrats, and the Greens if he won the general election. This projection is based on the results of the recent local election. The Prime Minister warns that the general election might result in a hung parliament where Labour would be the largest party. Some Conservative MPs and even some Labour ones believe that a poster the party used in the 2015 election, showing the then Labour leader, Ed Miliband, in the pocket of the former SNP leader, Alex Salmond, played a significant role in delivering the Conservatives an unexpected overall majority. However, the share of the vote won by the parties in local elections may not accurately reflect how they would perform in an immediate general election. There are two potential difficulties. Firstly, some people vote differently in local elections than they would in a general election. This can result in a divergence between party performance in local elections and their standing in national polls. Secondly, the party political battle in Scotland is now very different from that in England. English local elections do not tell us much about what will happen north of the border. These developments have made discerning the implications of local elections for the outcome of a general election more difficult. In addition, there are two particular features of the results of this year's local elections that make it especially difficult. Firstly, the polls suggest that more people who voted Conservative in 2019 have now switched to Reform than to Labour. However, Reform only stood in one in six council wards.

Additionally, there are two particular features of the results of this year's local elections that make it especially difficult to make predictions. Firstly, the polls suggest that more people who voted Conservative in 2019 have now switched to Reform than to Labour. However, Reform only stood in one in six council wards. This means that people who would vote Reform if there had been a Reform candidate locally may have stuck with the Tories instead. Indeed, Conservative support fell more heavily where Reform did stand. In the BBC's sample of key wards, the party's support fell by 19 points in these wards - compared with 11 points in wards where Reform did not stand. That 19-point drop matches the 19-point fall in the average level of Conservative support in the polls since May 2021. That figure may represent a better guide to the Conservatives' immediate prospects in a general election. Secondly, the local election results confirm the message from last year's contests that the geography of party support has changed to the Conservatives' disadvantage. The party's support fell more heavily in wards it was trying to defend. Some voters seemingly voted for whichever party was best placed to defeat the Conservatives locally. Labour's support increased most (at the expense of the Liberal Democrats) in wards where they started off second to the Conservatives. The Liberal Democrats advanced most (and Labour did less well) in wards where were the principal challengers locally. Indeed, it is these two patterns that help explain why the Conservative Party lost nearly one in two of the council seats it was trying to defend. Conservative MPs would be unwise to assume that the same fate could not also befall them."

            "The Labour Party is anticipating support from the SNP, Liberal Democrats, and Greens if they are successful in the upcoming election. This indicates the possibility of a hung parliament with Labour being the largest party. Some Conservative and even Labour MPs believe that a poster the party used in the 2015 election played a significant role in delivering the Conservatives an unexpected overall majority. The percentage of the vote won by the parties in local elections may not accurately reflect how they would perform in an immediate general election.

            "The upcoming 2025 election might see Labour become the largest party, backed by the SNP, Lib Dems, and Greens. This contrasts with the 2015 election, where the Conservative Party's poster helped them win an unexpected majority. Predicting the election based on local election results is difficult. Two potential challenges can cause a difference between how parties perform in local elections and their standing in national polls. Voters might vote differently in local elections than in a general election. The party political battle in Scotland is very different from that in England. Two specific features of the local election results make it hard to make predictions. More people who voted Conservative in 2019 have now switched to Reform than to Labour. The Conservative Party's support fell more heavily where Reform did stand than in wards where Reform did not stand. Conservative support fell by 19 points in wards where Reform stood, compared with 11 points in wards where Reform did not stand. The 19-point drop matches the 19-point fall in the average level of Conservative support in the polls since May 2021.

            "In the year 2025, Labour may emerge victorious in the upcoming elections. They are expected to receive support from the Scottish National Party (SNP), the Liberal Democrats (Lib Dems), and the Green Party. This contrasts with the 2015 election, where the Conservative Party's poster campaign helped them win an unexpected majority. Predicting the outcome of the election based solely on local election results can be challenging due to voter behavior and differences in the political landscapes between Scotland and other regions. Two factors contribute to the difficulty in predicting election outcomes accurately. Firstly, voter behavior may differ in local and general elections, and secondly, the political landscape in Scotland differs significantly from England. These two specific features of local election results make prediction even more challenging. Notably, more 2019 Conservative voters switched to the Reform Party than to Labour. Additionally, the Conservative Party's support dropped more heavily in areas where Reform did stand compared to areas where Reform did not stand. The 19-point drop in Conservative support aligns with the 19-point fall in Conservative polling since May 2021. These local election results confirm that party support has shifted against the Conservatives. They lost nearly half of the council seats they were defending, indicating that voters may have chosen the strongest challenger locally. Conservative MPs should not underestimate the possibility of experiencing a similar outcome in the upcoming elections."
