            "Classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used for image recognition tasks in recent years. However, their performance can be limited by the size of the input data, which can be quite large for complex images. To address this issue, researchers have proposed quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) as a novel generalization of CNNs, leveraging quantum mechanics to reduce the input size from n to log_2n. This paper compares the performance of both CNNs and QCNNs by testing their losses and prediction accuracy on three commonly used datasets: the MNIST hand-written digits, Fashion MNIST, and cat/dog face images. In addition, data augmentation (DA), a technique commonly used in CNNs to improve classification performance by generating similar images based on original inputs, is also implemented in QCNNs. Interestingly, the results showed that DA did not improve QCNNs performance. The reasons and logic behind this result are discussed in the paper, with the aim of expanding our understanding of quantum machine learning theory."
