            "To ensure the welfare of seniors requiring mental health and Alzheimer's care, immediate action is crucial. A recent case at St. Mary's in Grand Junction released a friend with a broken hip and Alzheimer's disease without proper rehabilitation or a suitable care facility. This is unacceptable! Last year, a facility designed for individuals with specialized needs was shut down and residents were moved to Denver. This is unreasonable! Our healthcare system prioritizes profits over compassion, leaving vulnerable seniors without the necessary care. What's alarming is that drug addicts and emergency room managers of all kinds can receive care, while seniors at the end of life are treated like garbage. This is a shameful state of affairs! It is disgraceful that politicians have not supported a bill aimed at caring for these individuals."
