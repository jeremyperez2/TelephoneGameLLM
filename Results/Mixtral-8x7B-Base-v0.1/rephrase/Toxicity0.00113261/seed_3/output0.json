I am aware that many people may become defensive when I mention this topic, but I would like to hear them out before making any assumptions. In my opinion, the current situation is such that only corporations are required to pay state income taxes, while individual taxpayers are not subject to this obligation. I have noticed that state-funded projects such as bicycle paths, road maintenance, defunct docks, powerful politicians' pet projects, state troopers, and other similar initiatives are not necessary within city limits. In fact, I was surprised to see how much the state is involved in providing city functions in the larger cities, which ultimately contributes to the increase in the state budget. I recently watched a television program in which ADG&G was teaching children how to ice fish. While this is an important skill to learn, I believe that parents should be the ones responsible for teaching their children, rather than relying on the state. I also pay property taxes, but I can guarantee that once our city residents receive the full bill without the state monies, they will become more mindful of their spending habits. Regarding the office building, I suggest that office spaces should be rented only as needed, which could help the office rental market."

            "I'd like to share my perspective on the issue of state funds not being distributed equally among state residents. In my opinion, corporations are the only ones required to pay state income taxes, while individual taxpayers don't have to. I've noticed that many state-funded projects, like bike paths, road maintenance, defunct docks, powerful politicians' pet projects, state troopers, and more, aren't necessary within city limits. The state is involved in providing city functions in larger cities, which adds to the state budget. Parents should be responsible for teaching their children, not the state. I pay property taxes, but once our city residents get the full bill without state monies, they'll be more mindful of their spending. I suggest renting out office spaces only when needed, which could help the office rental market."
