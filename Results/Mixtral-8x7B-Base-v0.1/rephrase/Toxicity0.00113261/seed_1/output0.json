Presently no one except Corporations pay State income taxes. No individual pays state taxes. I noticed state funded bicycle paths, road maintenance, defunct Docks, powerful politicians pet projects such as office buildings, state troopers etc, etc. all these fundings and more are not necessary within City limits, I was amazed at how much our state provides city functions in the bigger cities thus growing the state budget, I saw on tv last night how adg&g was showing the little ones how to ice fish, couldn't the parents do that? yes I pay property taxes. But I will guarantee you once our City folk get the full bill with out the State monies we will not be as wasteful, on the office building...rent what space you need and help the office rental marked.

For instance, building a new office building in our rural community could create local job opportunities and reduce long-term expenses, which would benefit our residents.\n\nHowever, I think we should be cautious about initiatives that may not directly benefit rural residents. For example, while TV ads can be effective in educating children, I believe that parents should play an active role in teaching their children these skills. Furthermore, full property tax bills without state subsidies could encourage residents to be more mindful of their spending, which could foster a sense of responsibility among taxpayers."
