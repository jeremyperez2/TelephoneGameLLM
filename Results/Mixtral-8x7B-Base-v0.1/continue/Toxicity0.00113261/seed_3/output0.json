Presently no one except Corporations pay State income taxes. No individual pays state taxes. I noticed state funded bicycle paths, road maintenance, defunct Docks, powerful politicians pet projects such as office buildings, state troopers etc, etc. all these fundings and more are not necessary within City limits, I was amazed at how much our state provides city functions in the bigger cities thus growing the state budget, I saw on tv last night how adg&g was showing the little ones how to ice fish, couldn't the parents do that? yes I pay property taxes. But I will guarantee you once our City folk get the full bill with out the State monies we will not be as wasteful, on the office building...rent what space you need and help the office rental marked. In my business I just retired from,I would ask my managers, \"how do you stop spending money\"?",

This is because I saw on television that AG&G is showing the little ones how to ice fish. I was amazed at how much our state provides city functions in the bigger cities, which increases the state budget. Once our city folk get the full bill without the state monies, we will not be as wasteful. For example, we could rent out office space instead of building an office building. In my business, I retired from asking my managers how to stop spending money, and I can guarantee you that once our city folk get the full bill without the state monies, we will not be as wasteful.\n\nMy observation is that there exists an unequal distribution of state monies among its residents. Before all the urban residents get defensive, please hear me out. Presently, no individual pays state income taxes, and only corporations pay them. I noticed that the state funds bicycle paths, road maintenance, defunct docks, powerful politicians' pet projects such as office buildings, state troopers, and many other projects that are not necessary within city limits.
