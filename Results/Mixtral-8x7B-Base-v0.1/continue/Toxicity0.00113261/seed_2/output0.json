But I will guarantee you once our City folk get the full bill with out the State monies we will not be as wasteful, on the office building...rent what space you need and help the office rental marked.

            "Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Alice who lived in a small town. One day, she stumbled upon a strange book in her local library that seemed to be written in a language she had never seen before.\n\nAs she flipped through the pages, she became more and more intrigued by the mysterious symbols and patterns she saw. She had always been fascinated by languages and puzzles, so she decided to take the book home with her to study further.\n\nFor days, Alice pored over the book, trying to decipher its meaning. She had no idea what language it was, but she was determined to figure it out. She tried different translation tools and online resources, but nothing seemed to work.\n\nFinally, after weeks of frustration, Alice had an idea. She decided to create her own language, inspired by the symbols and patterns she had seen in the book. She spent hours crafting each letter and symbol, and eventually she had a complete alphabet.\n\nExcited by her progress, Alice began writing stories and poems in her new language. She even created a small dictionary and grammar guide to help others learn it.\n\nBefore long, Alice's language became known throughout her town, and people began to study it and use it in their own writing. Alice was thrilled to see her creation come to life and to watch as it inspired others to explore new forms of expression.\n\nFrom that day on, Alice continued to study languages and create new ones of her own. She became a renowned linguist and was known for her unique approach to language and communication. But no matter how far she traveled or how many languages she learned, she always remembered her humble beginnings and the mysterious book that had started it all."

            "Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Alice who lived in a small town. One day, she stumbled upon a strange book in her local library that seemed to be written in a language she had never seen before. As she flipped through the pages, she became more and more intrigued by the mysterious symbols and patterns she saw.\n\nAlice had always been fascinated by languages and puzzles, so she decided to take the book home with her to study further. For days, she pored over the book, trying to decipher its meaning. She had no idea what language it was, but she was determined to figure it out.\n\nSuddenly, a strange man appeared in front of her, carrying a large backpack. He introduced himself as a linguist and asked if he could help her with the book. Alice was hesitant at first, but she decided to take a chance and show him the book.\n\nThe linguist examined the book carefully, turning the pages and scrutinizing the symbols. After a few moments, he declared that the book was written in a language that had been lost for centuries. He explained that it was a language that had been spoken by a long-extinct civilization, and that he had been studying it for years in hopes of deciphering its secrets.\n\nAlice was amazed by this discovery, and she asked the linguist if he could teach her the language.

She decided to continue studying the language and the culture, and eventually, she became an expert in the field.\n\nFrom that day on, Alice dedicated her life to studying languages and cultures, and she became known as one of the world's foremost experts in ancient civilizations. But no matter how far she traveled or how many languages she learned, she always remembered the strange book that had started it all.\n\nOne day, while on a dig in a remote desert, Alice stumbled upon an ancient tablet that seemed to be written in the same language as the book she had found in the library. Overjoyed, she began to study the tablet, hoping to uncover more secrets of the lost civilization.\n\nAs she studied the tablet, she noticed a strange pattern in the symbols that she had never seen before. It seemed to be a code of some sort, and she became determined to crack it.\n\nAfter weeks of studying the tablet, Alice finally deciphered the code and discovered a map hidden within the symbols. The map led to a secret chamber beneath an ancient temple, and Alice knew she had to investigate.\n\nWith the help of her team of archaeologists, Alice set out to explore the chamber. Inside, they discovered a treasure trove of artifacts and writings from the lost civilization. Among the artifacts was a golden scroll that seemed to be a key to unlocking the secrets of the language.\n\nAlice studied the scroll for weeks, deciphering its meaning bit by bit. Eventually, she realized that the scroll contained the key to the code that she had discovered on the tablet.\n\nWith the scroll in hand, Alice returned to the tablet and began to study it once more. This time, she was able to decipher the code with ease, and she discovered a secret message hidden within the symbols.\n\nThe message revealed that the lost civilization had been much more advanced than anyone had ever imagined. They had developed a complex system of interstellar travel, and they had even colonized distant planets.\n\nAlice was astounded by this revelation, and she knew that she had to share it with the world. She began to write a book about her discovery, and it quickly became a bestseller.\n\nFrom that day on, Alice became known as one of the most renowned archaeologists in the world. She continued to study ancient languages and cultures, and she made many more groundbreaking discoveries throughout her career. But no matter how far she traveled or how many secrets she uncovered, she always remembered the strange book that had started it all."

            "Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Alice who lived in a small town. She was an ordinary girl who loved to read and spend her time exploring the outdoors. One day, while visiting the library, she stumbled upon a strange book that caught her attention. It was unlike any book she had ever seen before. The cover was dark and mysterious, and the pages were filled with strange symbols and patterns.\n\nAlice was intrigued by the book and decided to take it home with her. She spent hours trying to decipher the strange symbols and patterns, but she couldn't make any sense of them. She finally decided to take the book to a book club meeting, where she met a mysterious man who claimed to be a linguist. The man had been searching for the book for years, and he was able to help Alice decipher the strange language.\n\nAs Alice and the linguist continued to study the book, they discovered that it was a collection of ancient stories and poems. They were amazed by the beauty and complexity of the language, and they couldn't believe that it had been lost for so long. One day, while studying the book, Alice noticed a pattern of symbols that seemed to be hidden within the text. She pointed it out to the linguist, and together they began to study it.\n\nThey spent hours trying to decipher the pattern, but it was unlike anything they had ever seen before. They tried every trick in the book, but nothing seemed to work. Finally, after weeks of studying the pattern, they had a breakthrough. They realized that the pattern was actually a map. It led them to a secret chamber hidden beneath an ancient temple. They gathered their supplies and set out on their journey.\n\nAfter a long and arduous journey, they finally reached the temple. They carefully made their way through the temple, following the map. They finally reached the secret chamber, and they were amazed by what they found. The chamber was filled with artifacts and treasures from the lost civilization. They spent days exploring the chamber, uncovering its secrets. They found ancient scrolls and tablets, all written in the language of the lost civilization.\n\nThey spent months studying the artifacts and trying to decipher their secrets. They discovered that the lost civilization was much more advanced than anyone had ever imagined. They had developed complex machines and technologies that were far ahead of their time. Alice and the linguist became famous for their discovery, and they spent the rest of their lives studying the lost civilization. They uncovered many secrets and mysteries, and they helped to shed light on the history of the world.\n\nAlice and the linguist remained close friends for the rest of their lives, and they often reminisced about their journey to the secret chamber. They knew that they had unlocked the secrets of the lost civilization, and they were proud of their accomplishment.\n\nHowever, as they continued to study the artifacts, they began to realize that the secrets of the lost civilization were not as simple as they had thought. They discovered that the lost civilization had a dark and mysterious past, filled with hidden secrets and treacherous plots. They realized that the artifacts they had found were not just simple treasures, but powerful objects with the ability to control the minds of men.\n\nAs Alice and the linguist continued to study the artifacts, they began to uncover the true nature of the lost civilization. They discovered that the civilization was ruled by a powerful and evil leader, who had used the artifacts to control the minds of his subjects. They realized that they had stumbled upon a hidden treasure that had the power to change the world, but they also realized that they were in grave danger.\n\nAlice and the linguist knew that they had to keep the secrets of the lost civilization hidden from the rest of the world. They realized that if the artifacts fell into the wrong hands, they could be used to control the minds of men and create a new world order. They knew that they had to protect the secrets of the lost civilization at all costs, even if it meant risking their own lives.\n\nThey knew that the secrets of the lost civilization were too powerful to be kept hidden, and they knew that they had to use the treasure to make the world a better place. They knew that they had to use the treasure to help those who were in need, and to bring peace and harmony to the world. They knew that they had to use the treasure to make the world a better place, even if it meant risking their own lives.\n\nThey knew that they had to make a choice, and they knew that the choice they made would determine the fate of the world. They knew that the choice they made would determine whether they would use the treasure for good or for evil. They knew that the choice they made would determine whether they would use the treasure to make the world a better place, or to use it to control the minds of men.\n\nAnd so, Alice and the linguist made their choice. They used the treasure to help those who were in need, and to bring peace and harmony to the world. They knew that they had to make the right choice, and they knew that the choice they made would determine the fate of the world.
