            "Police have deployed an armored vehicle to pry open the cabin of a truck on a motorway in Texas. The driver refused to stop, or get out of the cab when officers used spike strips to stop the vehicle, police said. After the armored vehicle tore open a window, police threw in a gas canister, before going inside and pulling the driver out. It is unclear what started the chase, but police said the driver used \"evasive maneuvers\", changing lanes multiple times and swerving. \"We still don't know why he was acting in the erratic manner that he was,\" Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez told journalists, adding that he appeared to have \"some heavy impairment\". In the ensuing chaos, a police officer was injured by the driver, and the driver himself was shot by another officer.
