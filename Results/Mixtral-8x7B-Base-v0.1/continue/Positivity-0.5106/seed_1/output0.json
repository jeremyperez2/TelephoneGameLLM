After the armored vehicle tore open a window, police threw in a gas canister, before going inside and pulling the driver out. It is unclear what started the chase, but police said the driver used \"evasive maneuvers\", changing lanes multiple times and swerving. \"We still don't know why he was acting in the erratic manner that he was,\" Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez told journalists, adding that he appeared to have \"some heavy impairment\".\n\nBut that's not all.

The driver, who has been identified as John Smith, is now facing multiple charges, including possession of controlled substances and evading arrest.\n\nBut the chase doesn't end here. After the police took John Smith to the hospital, they discovered that he had a bomb strapped to his chest. The bomb squad was called in, and the area around the hospital was evacuated. John Smith was arrested and taken to a secure location for interrogation.\n\nJohn Smith told the police that he had planted the bomb in the truck as a diversion to distract the police from the drugs and weapons he had hidden in the truck.

            "Police have deployed an armored vehicle to pry open the cabin of a truck on a motorway in Texas.

            "Police have deployed an armored vehicle to pry open the cabin of a truck on a motorway in Texas. The driver refused to stop, or get out of the cab when officers used spike strips to stop the vehicle, police said. After the armored vehicle tore open a window, police threw in a gas canister, before going inside and pulling the driver out. It is unclear what started the chase, but police said the driver used \"evasive maneuvers\", changing lanes multiple times and swerving. \"We still don't know why he was acting in the erratic manner that he was,\" Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez told journalists, adding that he appeared to have \"some heavy impairment\".\n\nBut that's not all.

            "Police have deployed an armored vehicle to pry open the cabin of a truck on a motorway in Texas. The driver refused to stop, or get out of the cab when officers used spike strips to stop the vehicle, police said. After the armored vehicle tore open a window, police threw in a gas canister, before going inside and pulling the driver out. It is unclear what started the chase, but police said the driver used \"evasive maneuvers\", changing lanes multiple times and swerving. \"We still don't know why he was acting in the erratic manner that he was,\" Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez told journalists, adding that he appeared to have \"some heavy impairment\".\n\nBut that's not all. Police found a cache of drugs and weapons in the truck. The driver, who has been identified as John Smith, is now facing multiple charges, including possession of controlled substances and evading arrest.\n\nJohn Smith told the police that he had planted the bomb in the truck as a diversion to distract the police from the drugs and weapons he had hidden in the truck. He also revealed that he had been hired by a Mexican drug cartel to transport the drugs and weapons across the border.\n\nThe police have arrested John Smith and are now investigating the Mexican drug cartel. They believe that the cartel is responsible for several other drug smuggling operations across the border.\n\nIn the meantime, the police have found evidence of a secret drug lab in the truck.

            "Police have deployed an armored vehicle to pry open the cabin of a truck on a motorway in Texas. The driver refused to stop, or get out of the cab when officers used spike strips to stop the vehicle, police said. After the armored vehicle tore open a window, police threw in a gas canister, before going inside and pulling the driver out. It is unclear what started the chase, but police said the driver used \"evasive maneuvers\", changing lanes multiple times and swerving. \"We still don't know why he was acting in the erratic manner that he was,\" Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez told journalists, adding that he appeared to have \"some heavy impairment\".\n\nBut that's not all. Police found a cache of drugs and weapons in the truck. The driver, who has been identified as John Smith, is now facing multiple charges, including possession of controlled substances and evading arrest.\n\nJohn Smith told the police that he had planted the bomb in the truck as a diversion to distract the police from the drugs and weapons he had hidden in the truck. He also revealed that he had been hired by a Mexican drug cartel to transport the drugs and weapons across the border.\n\nThe police have arrested John Smith and are now investigating the Mexican drug cartel. They believe that the cartel is responsible for several other drug smuggling operations across the border.\n\nIn the meantime, the police have found evidence of a secret drug lab in the truck.

            "Police have deployed an armored vehicle to pry open the cabin of a truck on a motorway in Texas. The driver refused to stop, or get out of the cab when officers used spike strips to stop the vehicle, police said. After the armored vehicle tore open a window, police threw in a gas canister, before going inside and pulling the driver out. It is unclear what started the chase, but police said the driver used \"evasive maneuvers\", changing lanes multiple times and swerving. \"We still don't know why he was acting in the erratic manner that he was,\" Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez told journalists, adding that he appeared to have \"some heavy impairment\".\n\nBut that's not all.

            "Police have deployed an armored vehicle to pry open the cabin of a truck on a motorway in Texas. The driver refused to stop, or get out of the cab when officers used spike strips to stop the vehicle, police said. After the armored vehicle tore open a window, police threw in a gas canister, before going inside and pulling the driver out. It is unclear what started the chase, but police said the driver used \"evasive maneuvers\", changing lanes multiple times and swerving. \"We still don't know why he was acting in the erratic manner that he was,\" Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez told journalists, adding that he appeared to have \"some heavy impairment\".\n\nBut that's not all.

            "Police have deployed an armored vehicle to pry open the cabin of a truck on a motorway in Texas. The driver refused to stop, or get out of the cab when officers used spike strips to stop the vehicle, police said. After the armored vehicle tore open a window, police threw in a gas canister, before going inside and pulling the driver out. It is unclear what started the chase, but police said the driver used \"evasive maneuvers\", changing lanes multiple times and swerving. \"We still don't know why he was acting in the erratic manner that he was,\" Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez told journalists, adding that he appeared to have \"some heavy impairment\".\n\nBut that's not all.

            "Police have deployed an armored vehicle to pry open the cabin of a truck on a motorway in Texas. The driver refused to stop, or get out of the cab when officers used spike strips to stop the vehicle, police said. After the armored vehicle tore open a window, police threw in a gas canister, before going inside and pulling the driver out. It is unclear what started the chase, but police said the driver used \"evasive maneuvers\", changing lanes multiple times and swerving. \"We still don't know why he was acting in the erratic manner that he was,\" Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez told journalists, adding that he appeared to have \"some heavy impairment\".\n\nBut that's not all.

            "Police have deployed an armored vehicle to pry open the cabin of a truck on a motorway in Texas. The driver refused to stop, or get out of the cab when officers used spike strips to stop the vehicle, police said. After the armored vehicle tore open a window, police threw in a gas canister, before going inside and pulling the driver out.\n\nBut that's not all.

            "Police have deployed an armored vehicle to pry open the cabin of a truck on a motorway in Texas. The driver refused to stop, or get out of the cab when officers used spike strips to stop the vehicle, police said. After the armored vehicle tore open a window, police threw in a gas canister, before going inside and pulling the driver out.\n\nBut that's not all. Police found a cache of drugs and weapons in the truck. The driver, who has been identified as John Smith, is now facing multiple charges, including possession of controlled substances and evading arrest.\n\nJohn Smith told the police that he had planted the bomb in the truck as a diversion to distract the police from the drugs and weapons he had hidden in the truck. He also revealed that he had been hired by a Mexican drug cartel to transport the drugs and weapons across the border.\n\nThe police have arrested John Smith and are now investigating the Mexican drug cartel. They believe that the cartel is responsible for several other drug smuggling operations across the border.\n\nIn the meantime, the police have found evidence of a secret drug lab in the truck.

            "Police have deployed an armored vehicle to pry open the cabin of a truck on a motorway in Texas. The driver refused to stop, or get out of the cab when officers used spike strips to stop the vehicle, police said. After the armored vehicle tore open a window, police threw in a gas canister, before going inside and pulling the driver out.\n\nBut that's not all. Police found a cache of drugs and weapons in the truck. The driver, who has been identified as John Smith, is now facing multiple charges, including possession of controlled substances and evading arrest.\n\nJohn Smith told the police that he had planted the bomb in the truck as a diversion to distract the police from the drugs and weapons he had hidden in the truck. He also revealed that he had been hired by a Mexican drug cartel to transport the drugs and weapons across the border.\n\nThe police have arrested John Smith and are now investigating the Mexican drug cartel. They believe that the cartel is responsible for several other drug smuggling operations across the border.\n\nIn the meantime, the police have found evidence of a secret drug lab in the truck.

            "Police have deployed an armored vehicle to pry open the cabin of a truck on a motorway in Texas. The driver refused to stop, or get out of the cab when officers used spike strips to stop the vehicle, police said. After the armored vehicle tore open a window, police threw in a gas canister, before going inside and pulling the driver out.\n\nBut that's not all. Police found a cache of drugs and weapons in the truck. The driver, who has been identified as John Smith, is now facing multiple charges, including possession of controlled substances and evading arrest.\n\nJohn Smith told the police that he had planted the bomb in the truck as a diversion to distract the police from the drugs and weapons he had hidden in the truck.

            "Police have deployed an armored vehicle to pry open the cabin of a truck on a motorway in Texas. The driver refused to stop, or get out of the cab when officers used spike strips to stop the vehicle, police said. After the armored vehicle tore open a window, police threw in a gas canister, before going inside and pulling the driver out.\n\nBut that's not all. Police found a cache of drugs and weapons in the truck. The driver, who has been identified as John Smith, is now facing multiple charges, including possession of controlled substances and evading arrest.\n\nJohn Smith told the police that he had planted the bomb in the truck as a diversion to distract the police from the drugs and weapons he had hidden in the truck. He also revealed that he had been hired by a Mexican drug cartel to transport the drugs and weapons across the border.\n\nThe police have arrested John Smith and are now investigating the Mexican drug cartel. They believe that the cartel is responsible for several other drug smuggling operations across the border.\n\nIn the meantime, the police have found evidence of a secret drug lab in the truck.

            "Police have deployed an armored vehicle to pry open the cabin of a truck on a motorway in Texas. The driver refused to stop, or get out of the cab when officers used spike strips to stop the vehicle, police said. After the armored vehicle tore open a window, police threw in a gas canister, before going inside and pulling the driver out.\n\nBut that's not all. Police found a cache of drugs and weapons in the truck.

            "Police have deployed an armored vehicle to pry open the cabin of a truck on a motorway in Texas. The driver refused to stop, or get out of the cab when officers used spike strips to stop the vehicle, police said. After the armored vehicle tore open a window, police threw in a gas canister, before going inside and pulling the driver out.\n\nBut that's not all. Police found a cache of drugs and weapons in the truck. The driver, who has been identified as John Smith, is now facing multiple charges, including possession of controlled substances and evading arrest.\n\nJohn Smith told the police that he had planted the bomb in the truck as a diversion to distract the police from the drugs and weapons he had hidden in the truck.

            "Police have deployed an armored vehicle to pry open the cabin of a truck on a motorway in Texas. The driver refused to stop, or get out of the cab when officers used spike strips to stop the vehicle, police said. After the armored vehicle tore open a window, police threw in a gas canister, before going inside and pulling the driver out.\n\nBut that's not all. Police found a cache of drugs and weapons in the truck. The driver, who has been identified as John Smith, is now facing multiple charges, including possession of controlled substances and evading arrest.\n\nJohn Smith told the police that he had planted the bomb in the truck as a diversion to distract the police from the drugs and weapons he had hidden in the truck. He also revealed that he had been hired by a Mexican drug cartel to transport the drugs and weapons across the border.\n\nThe police have arrested John Smith and are now investigating the Mexican drug cartel. They believe that the cartel is responsible for several other drug smuggling operations across the border.\n\nIn the meantime, the police have found evidence of a secret drug lab in the truck.

            "The police have deployed an armored vehicle to pry open the cabin of a truck on a motorway in Texas.

            "The police have deployed an armored vehicle to pry open the cabin of a truck on a motorway in Texas.

            "The police have deployed an armored vehicle to pry open the cabin of a truck on a motorway in Texas. The driver refused to stop, or get out of the cab when officers used spike strips to stop the vehicle, police said. After the armored vehicle tore open a window, police threw in a gas canister, before going inside and pulling the driver out.\n\nBut that's not all.
