for computing. to address this issue, in this paper, we propose aframework called oplixnet to compress the areas of onns by modulating inputimage data into the amplitudes and phase parts of light signals. the input andoutput parts of the onns are redesigned to make full use of both amplitude andphase information. moreover, mutual learning across different onn structures isintroduced to maintain the accuracy. experimental results demonstrate that theproposed framework significantly reduces the areas of onns with the accuracywithin an acceptable range. for instance, 75.03% area is reduced with a 0.33%accuracy decrease on fully connected neural network (fcnn) and 74.88% area isreduced with a 2.38% accuracy decrease on resnet-32.\n\nbut, we propose a new approach to solve this
