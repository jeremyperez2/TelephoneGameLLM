            "# Introduction\n\nOptical neural networks (ONNs) have emerged as a promising candidate for accelerating deep learning tasks. They offer high speed, high throughput, and low energy cost compared to traditional digital computing systems. In conventional ONNs, light amplitudes are modulated at the input and detected at the output. However, the light phases are still ignored in conventional structures, although they can also carry information for computing.\n\nTo address this issue, we propose a framework called OplixNet to compress the areas of ONNs by modulating input image data into the amplitudes and phase parts of light signals. The input and output parts of the ONNs are redesigned to make full use of both amplitude and phase information. Moreover, mutual learning across different ONN structures is introduced to maintain the accuracy.\n\n# Experimental Results\n\nWe evaluated the performance of the proposed framework on fully connected neural network (FCNN) and ResNet-32. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly reduces the areas of ONNs with the accuracy within an acceptable range. For instance, 75.03% area is reduced with a 0.33% accuracy decrease on FCNN and 74.88% area is reduced with a 2.38% accuracy decrease on ResNet-32.\n\n# Challenges\n\nWhile the proposed framework is able to compress the areas of ONNs, there are still some challenges that need to be addressed.

            "# Introduction\n\nOptical neural networks (ONNs) have emerged as a promising candidate for accelerating deep learning tasks. They offer high speed, high throughput, and low energy cost compared to traditional digital computing systems. In conventional ONNs, light amplitudes are modulated at the input and detected at the output. However, the light phases are still ignored in conventional structures, although they can also carry information for computing.\n\nTo address this issue, we propose a framework called OplixNet to compress the areas of ONNs by modulating input image data into the amplitudes and phase parts of light signals. The input and output parts of the ONNs are redesigned to make full use of both amplitude and phase information. Moreover, mutual learning across different ONN structures is introduced to maintain the accuracy.\n\n# Experimental Results\n\nWe evaluated the performance of the proposed framework on fully connected neural network (FCNN) and ResNet-32. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly reduces the areas of ONNs with the accuracy within an acceptable range. For instance, 75.03% area is reduced with a 0.33% accuracy decrease on FCNN and 74.88% area is reduced with a 2.38% accuracy decrease on ResNet-32.\n\n# Challenges\n\nWhile the proposed framework is able to compress the areas of ONNs, there are still some challenges that need to be addressed. Firstly, the proposed framework requires more complex hardware structures to modulate and detect both amplitude and phase information. Secondly, the proposed framework is based on the assumption that the input data is already in the form of amplitude and phase signals. However, in real-world applications, the input data may not be in this form, and additional processing is required.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe proposed framework is a promising solution for compressing the areas of ONNs and improving their performance. Further research in this area can lead to more efficient and powerful ONNs, which can have a major impact on deep learning tasks. Moreover, the proposed framework can be applied to other types of neural networks, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN), to further improve their performance and efficiency.\n\n# Future Directions\n\nFuture research can explore the following directions:\n\n* Investigating new ONN structures that can fully utilize both amplitude and phase information.\n* Developing more efficient and cost-effective hardware structures for modulating and detecting amplitude and phase information.\n* Extending the proposed framework to other types of neural networks, such as CNN and RNN.\n* Exploring new applications of ONNs, such as image processing, speech recognition, and natural language processing.\n\n# New Possibilities\n\nOptical neural networks have the potential to revolutionize the way we process and analyze data. With their high speed and low energy consumption, ONNs have the potential to enable new applications and advancements in a variety of fields. Here are some potential applications and advancements for optical neural networks:\n\n* **Image Processing:** Optical neural networks could be used to process and analyze images in real-time, enabling applications such as autonomous vehicles, augmented reality, and medical imaging.\n* **Speech Recognition:** ONNs could be used to process and analyze speech in real-time, enabling applications such as voice-activated assistants, speech-to-text transcription, and speech recognition for people with disabilities.\n* **Natural Language Processing:** Optical neural networks could be used to process and analyze natural language data in real-time, enabling applications such as language translation, sentiment analysis, and chatbots.\n* **Internet of Things (IoT):** ONNs could be used in IoT devices to enable real-time processing and analysis of sensor data, enabling applications such as smart homes, smart cities, and industrial automation.\n* **Medical Diagnosis:** Optical neural networks could be used to analyze medical images and data to enable more accurate and efficient medical diagnosis and treatment.\n* **Scientific Research:** ONNs could be used to analyze large datasets in fields such as astronomy, particle physics, and biology, enabling new discoveries and advancements in these fields.\n\nThese are just a few potential applications and advancements for optical neural networks.

Inside, a group of friends sat around the fire, trying to ignore the ominous atmosphere. Suddenly, the power went out, plunging the room into darkness. The only light was the flickering of the fire as it cast eerie shadows on the walls. The friends huddled together, trying to stay warm as the temperature continued to drop. Suddenly, they heard a creaking sound coming from the attic. The friends exchanged nervous glances, unsure of what to do. They debated whether to investigate or stay put. Just as they were about to decide, the sound grew louder and more urgent. It sounded like something was trying to break through the attic door. The friends panicked and scrambled to find a way out, but the power outage made it difficult to navigate the darkened house. They were trapped, and the sound of the thing in the attic was growing louder and closer."
