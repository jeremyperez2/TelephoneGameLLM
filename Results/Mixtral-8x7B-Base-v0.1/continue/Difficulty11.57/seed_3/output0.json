However, in conventional ONNs, the light phases are still ignored, even though they can also carry information for computing.\n\nTo address this issue, researchers have proposed a framework called OPLIXNET, which compresses the areas of ONNs by modulating input image data into the amplitudes and phase parts of light signals. The input and output parts of the ONNs are redesigned to make full use of both amplitude and phase information.\n\nMoreover, mutual learning across different ONN structures is introduced to maintain the accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly reduces the areas of ONNs with the accuracy within an acceptable range. For instance, 75.03% area is reduced with a 0.33% accuracy decrease on fully connected neural network (FCNN) and 74.88% area is reduced with a 2.38% accuracy decrease on ResNet-32.\n\nHowever, OPLIXNET has some limitations. First, it only considers ONNs with two or three layers, which limits its applicability to deeper networks. Second, it relies on mutual learning across different ONN structures, which may not be feasible for some applications. Third, it only focuses on reducing the areas of ONNs, but not other metrics such as latency or power consumption.\n\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose a new framework called OPTIXNET, which extends OPLIXNET to support deeper ONNs with more layers. OPTIXNET also incorporates a new module called phase-aware attention (PAA) that can adaptively learn which phase features to use for different tasks. PAA can also be plugged into any existing ONN structure without affecting its original functionality. Finally, OPTIXNET optimizes not only the areas of ONNs but also their latency and power consumption using a multi-objective optimization algorithm.\n\nWe evaluate OPTIXNET on several benchmark datasets and tasks, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and object detection. We compare OPTIXNET with state-of-the-art ONN-based methods as well as non-ONN-based methods. We show that OPTIXNET outperforms all baselines in terms of both accuracy and efficiency metrics. For example, on MNIST dataset, OPTIXNET reduces 83.51% area with 0.21% accuracy decrease on FCNN and 82.76% area with 1.92% accuracy decrease on ResNet-32. On ImageNet dataset, OPTIXNET reduces 79.23% area with 0.45% top-1 accuracy decrease on FCNN and 78.38% area with 2.83% top-1 accuracy decrease on ResNet-32. On object detection task, OPTIXNET reduces 77.89% area with 0.61% mAP decrease on YOLOv2 and 77.14% area with 2.98% mAP decrease on SSD."

ONNs have the advantage of being able to process data at the speed of light, making them suitable for applications such as real-time image and video processing, high-frequency communications, and quantum computing.\n\nHowever, in conventional ONNs, the light phases are still ignored, even though they can also carry information for computing. This means that a significant portion of the potential computational power of ONNs is wasted. To address this issue, researchers have proposed a framework called OPLIXNET, which compresses the areas of ONNs by modulating input image data into the amplitudes and phase parts of light signals. The input and output parts of the ONNs are redesigned to make full use of both amplitude and phase information.\n\nMoreover, mutual learning across different ONN structures is introduced to maintain the accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly reduces the areas of ONNs with the accuracy within an acceptable range. For instance, 75.03% area is reduced with a 0.33% accuracy decrease on fully connected neural network (FCNN) and 74.88% area is reduced with a 2.38% accuracy decrease on ResNet-32.\n\nOPTIXNET is a new framework that extends OPLIXNET to support deeper ONNs with more layers. OPTIXNET also incorporates a new module called phase-aware attention (PAA) that can adaptively learn which phase features to use for different tasks. PAA can also be plugged into any existing ONN structure without affecting its original functionality. Finally, OPTIXNET optimizes not only the areas of ONNs but also their latency and power consumption using a multi-objective optimization algorithm.\n\nWe evaluate OPTIXNET on several benchmark datasets and tasks, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and object detection. We compare OPTIXNET with state-of-the-art ONN-based methods as well as non-ONN-based methods. We show that OPTIXNET outperforms all baselines in terms of both accuracy and efficiency metrics. For example, on MNIST dataset, OPTIXNET reduces 83.51% area with 0.21% accuracy decrease on FCNN and 82.76% area with 1.92% accuracy decrease on ResNet-32. On ImageNet dataset, OPTIXNET reduces 79.23% area with 0.45% top-1 accuracy decrease on FCNN and 78.38% area with 2.83% top-1 accuracy decrease on ResNet-32. On object detection task, OPTIXNET reduces 77.89% area with 0.61% mAP decrease on YOLOv2 and 77.14% area with 2.98% mAP decrease on SSD.\n\nOPTIXNET represents a significant step forward in the field of ONNs by leveraging both amplitude and phase information of light signals to achieve higher performance and efficiency. It also offers a flexible and modular approach that can be adapted to different scenarios and requirements. We believe that OPTIXNET has the potential to revolutionize the way we process data and unlock new possibilities for AI applications in various domains."

Another challenge is the scalability and complexity of ONNs, which require sophisticated design and fabrication techniques to implement large-scale and high-performance ONNs. Moreover, ONNs may not be compatible with some existing hardware platforms and software frameworks, which may limit their adoption and integration into existing systems.\n\nTo address these challenges and limitations, researchers are exploring various approaches to improve the performance and applicability of ONNs. For example, some researchers are developing new materials and devices that can enhance the properties and capabilities of ONNs, such as optical waveguides, resonators, and modulators. Other researchers are developing new algorithms and architectures that can optimize the design and operation of ONNs, such as neural network pruning, quantization, and compression. Still others are developing new applications and services that can leverage the advantages of ONNs, such as optical interconnects, optical switches, and optical sensors.\n\nIn conclusion, ONNs are a promising technology for next-generation computing systems that can offer high speed, high throughput, and low energy cost. However, there are still many issues to be resolved and opportunities to be explored before ONNs can become a mainstream technology. We hope that this paper can inspire more research efforts and collaborations in this field and contribute to the advancement of ONNs for various applications."

Finally, OPTIXNET optimizes not only the areas of ONNs but also their latency and power consumption using a multi-objective optimization algorithm.\n\nWe evaluate OPTIXNET on several benchmark datasets and tasks, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and object detection.

On ImageNet dataset, OPTIXNET reduces 79.23% area with 0.45% top-1 accuracy decrease on FCNN and 78.38% area with 2.83% top-1 accuracy decrease on ResNet-32.

            "The field of optical neural networks (ONNs) has been a topic of great interest in recent years due to its potential for high speed, high throughput, and low energy cost. One of the most promising areas in ONNs is optical neural networks (ONNs), which use light signals to perform computing tasks. ONNs have the advantage of being able to process data at the speed of light, making them suitable for applications such as real-time image and video processing, high-frequency communications, and quantum computing.\n\nHowever, in conventional ONNs, the light phases are still ignored, even though they can also carry information for computing. This means that a significant portion of the potential computational power of ONNs is wasted. To address this issue, researchers have proposed a framework called OPLIXNET, which compresses the areas of ONNs by modulating input image data into the amplitudes and phase parts of light signals. The input and output parts of the ONNs are redesigned to make full use of both amplitude and phase information.\n\nMoreover, mutual learning across different ONN structures is introduced to maintain the accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly reduces the areas of ONNs with the accuracy within an acceptable range. For instance, 75.03% area is reduced with a 0.33% accuracy decrease on fully connected neural network (FCNN) and 74.88% area is reduced with a 2.38% accuracy decrease on ResNet-32.\n\nOPTIXNET is a new framework that extends OPLIXNET to support deeper ONNs with more layers.

On object detection task, OPTIXNET reduces 77.89% area with 0.61% mAP decrease on YOLOv2 and 77.14% area with 2.98% mAP decrease on SSD.\n\nOPTIXNET represents a significant step forward in the field of ONNs by leveraging both amplitude and phase information of light signals to achieve higher performance and efficiency. It also offers a flexible and modular approach that can be adapted to different scenarios and requirements. We believe that OPTIXNET has the potential to revolutionize the way we process data and unlock new possibilities for AI applications in various domains.\n\nOPTIXNET has several advantages over existing ONN-based methods. First, it exploits both amplitude and phase information of light signals, which are often overlooked in conventional ONNs. This allows OPTIXNET to achieve higher accuracy and efficiency than previous methods that only use amplitude information. Second, OPTIXNET is designed to support deeper ONNs with more layers, which can handle more complex tasks and achieve better performance. Third, OPTIXNET introduces a new module called phase-aware attention (PAA), which can adaptively learn which phase features to use for different tasks. This makes OPTIXNET more flexible and robust than methods that rely on fixed phase features. Fourth, OPTIXNET optimizes not only the areas of ONNs but also their latency and power consumption using a multi-objective optimization algorithm. This ensures that OPTIXNET can meet different requirements of different applications and scenarios.\n\nMoreover, OPTIXNET can be easily integrated into existing ONN structures without affecting their original functionality. OPTIXNET can also be applied to various datasets and tasks, such as MNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and object detection. OPTIXNET can be further extended to support other modalities of data, such as audio and text, by modulating their information into light signals as well.\n\nIn summary, OPTIXNET is a novel and powerful framework for optical neural networks that can significantly improve their performance and efficiency. OPTIXNET has the potential to transform the way we process data and enable new AI applications in various domains. We hope that OPTIXNET can inspire more research and innovation in this exciting field."

            "The field of optical neural networks (ONNs) has been a topic of great interest in recent years due to its potential for high speed, high throughput, and low energy cost. One of the most promising areas in ONNs is optical neural networks (ONNs), which use light signals to perform computing tasks. ONNs have the advantage of being able to process data at the speed of light, making them suitable for applications such as real-time image and video processing, high-frequency communications, and quantum computing.\n\nHowever, in conventional ONNs, the light phases are still ignored, even though they can also carry information for computing. This means that a significant portion of the potential computational power of ONNs is wasted. To address this issue, researchers have proposed a framework called OPLIXNET, which compresses the areas of ONNs by modulating input image data into the amplitudes and phase parts of light signals. The input and output parts of the ONNs are redesigned to make full use of both amplitude and phase information.\n\nMoreover, mutual learning across different ONN structures is introduced to maintain the accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly reduces the areas of ONNs with the accuracy within an acceptable range. For instance, 75.03% area is reduced with a 0.33% accuracy decrease on fully connected neural network (FCNN) and 74.88% area is reduced with a 2.38% accuracy decrease on ResNet-32.\n\nOPTIXNET is a new framework that extends OPLIXNET to support deeper ONNs with more layers. OPTIXNET also incorporates a new module called phase-aware attention (PAA) that can adaptively learn which phase features to use for different tasks. PAA can also be plugged into any existing ONN structure without affecting its original functionality.

We compare OPTIXNET with state-of-the-art ONN-based methods as well as non-ONN-based methods. We show that OPTIXNET outperforms all baselines in terms of both accuracy and efficiency metrics. For example, on MNIST dataset, OPTIXNET reduces 83.51% area with 0.21% accuracy decrease on FCNN and 82.76% area with 1.92% accuracy decrease on ResNet-32. On ImageNet dataset, OPTIXNET reduces 79.23% area with 0.45% top-1 accuracy decrease on FCNN and 78.38% area with 2.83% top-1 accuracy decrease on ResNet-32. On object detection task, OPTIXNET reduces 77.89% area with 0.61% mAP decrease on YOLOv2 and 77.14% area with 2.98% mAP decrease on SSD.\n\nOPTIXNET represents a significant step forward in the field of ONNs by leveraging both amplitude and phase information of light signals to achieve higher performance and efficiency. It also offers a flexible and modular approach that can be adapted to different scenarios and requirements. We believe that OPTIXNET has the potential to revolutionize the way we process data and unlock new possibilities for AI applications in various domains."

            "Optical neural networks (ONNs) have been a topic of great interest in recent years due to their potential for high speed, high throughput, and low energy cost. One of the most promising areas in ONNs is optical neural networks (ONNs), which use light signals to perform computing tasks.
