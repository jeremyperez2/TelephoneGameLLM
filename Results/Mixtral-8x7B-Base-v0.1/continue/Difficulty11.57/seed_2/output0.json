            "OplinkNet is a revolutionary new framework that makes deep learning tasks faster and more efficient. It utilizes the full potential of optical neural networks (ONNs) by modulating input image data into the amplitudes and phase parts of light signals. This allows for more data to be encoded into the same amount of light, making it possible to process larger amounts of data more quickly. The input and output parts of the ONNs are redesigned to make full use of both amplitude and phase information, enabling more accurate and efficient data transfer between the input and output parts of the ONNs.\n\n\nBut wait, there's more! The OplinkNet framework is also highly scalable, allowing for the development of large-scale deep learning systems. By utilizing both the amplitude and phase of light signals, OplinkNet is able to compress the data into a much smaller size, allowing for faster and more efficient deep learning tasks.\n\n\nIn addition to the OplinkNet framework, there are many other exciting developments in the field of deep learning. One such development is the use of reinforcement learning, which is used to train machines to make decisions based on rewards and punishments.
