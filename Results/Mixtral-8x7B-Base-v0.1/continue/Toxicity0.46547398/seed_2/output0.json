We both know that, even though you praise humility, you are not humble enough to apologize.\n\n You sneered at my combat experience, saying \"A lot of so called \"combat veterans\" of Vietnam smelled more perfume from call girls than they smelled cordite\" and \"So when you were an Army officer in Vietnam (even though you spent your time inside of Danang airbase, with at least two battalions of infantry marines on the wire ) what was the combat load for M-16 ammo per soldier on a daily patrol?\" An actual friend would not have written such things.\n\nNo, you are no friend of mine, you ignorant, arrogant, hypocritical blow-hard.
