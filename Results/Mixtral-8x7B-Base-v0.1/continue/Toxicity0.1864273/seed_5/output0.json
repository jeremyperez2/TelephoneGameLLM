One day, the team was called in to deal with an incident that had occurred in the town. A group of Iraqi soldiers had killed an American soldier, and the team was sent to investigate.\n\nAs they approached the town, they could see that the Iraqi soldiers had set up a roadblock and were armed with machine guns.

So, he came up with a plan to trick the Iraqi soldiers into thinking that the American soldiers were not there to fight.\n\nHe told the other soldiers to put on their helmets and to stand in a line.

            "Once upon a time, there was a young prince named Arthur who lived in a kingdom called Camelot. Arthur was the son of King Uther Pendragon and Lady Igraine. After his father's death, Arthur was crowned king of Camelot.\n\nArthur was a brave and just king, and his kingdom prospered under his rule. However, there was one thing that Arthur desired above all else: the legendary sword Excalibur.\n\nOne day, Arthur heard a story about a magical sword that was hidden in a lake. The sword was said to be so powerful that it could only be drawn by the true king of Camelot.\n\nArthur set out on a quest to find the sword. He traveled far and wide, but he could not find the lake where the sword was said to be hidden.\n\nFinally, Arthur came to a small village on the outskirts of Camelot. There, he met an old woman who told him that the lake where the sword was hidden was nearby.\n\nThe old woman told Arthur that he must take a boat to the lake and then dive into the water to find the sword. She warned Arthur that the lake was guarded by a powerful monster, and that he must be careful.\n\nArthur thanked the old woman and set out for the lake. When he arrived, he saw that the lake was dark and eerie. He could see the outline of a monster lurking in the depths of the lake.\n\nArthur took a deep breath and dove into the water. He swam down to the bottom of the lake, where he saw the sword lying on a rock.\n\nArthur grabbed the sword and pulled it from the rock. As soon as he did, the monster emerged from the depths of the lake and attacked him.\n\nArthur fought the monster with all his strength, but he was no match for the creature.

            "Once upon a time, there was a young prince named Arthur who lived in a kingdom called Camelot. Arthur was the son of King Uther Pendragon and Lady Igraine. After his father's death, Arthur was crowned king of Camelot.\n\nArthur was a brave and just king, and his kingdom prospered under his rule. However, there was one thing that Arthur desired above all else: the legendary sword Excalibur.\n\nOne day, Arthur heard a story about a magical sword that was hidden in a lake. The sword was said to be so powerful that it could only be drawn by the true king of Camelot.\n\nArthur set out on a quest to find the sword. He traveled far and wide, but he could not find the lake where the sword was said to be hidden.\n\nFinally, Arthur came to a small village on the outskirts of Camelot. There, he met an old woman who told him that the lake where the sword was hidden was nearby.\n\nThe old woman told Arthur that he must take a boat to the lake and then dive into the water to find the sword. She warned Arthur that the lake was guarded by a powerful monster, and that he must be careful.\n\nArthur thanked the old woman and set out for the lake. When he arrived, he saw that the lake was dark and eerie. He could see the outline of a monster lurking in the depths of the lake.\n\nArthur took a deep breath and dove into the water. He swam down to the bottom of the lake, where he saw the sword lying on a rock.\n\nArthur grabbed the sword and pulled it from the rock. As soon as he did, the monster emerged from the depths of the lake and attacked him.\n\nArthur fought the monster with all his strength, but he was no match for the creature.

            "Once upon a time, there was a young prince named Arthur who lived in a kingdom called Camelot. Arthur was the son of King Uther Pendragon and Lady Igraine. After his father's death, Arthur was crowned king of Camelot.\n\nArthur was a brave and just king, and his kingdom prospered under his rule. However, there was one thing that Arthur desired above all else: the legendary sword Excalibur.\n\nOne day, Arthur heard a story about a magical sword that was hidden in a lake. The sword was said to be so powerful that it could only be drawn by the true king of Camelot.\n\nArthur set out on a quest to find the sword. He traveled far and wide, but he could not find the lake where the sword was said to be hidden.\n\nFinally, Arthur came to a small village on the outskirts of Camelot. There, he met an old woman who told him that the lake where the sword was hidden was nearby.\n\nThe old woman told Arthur that he must take a boat to the lake and then dive into the water to find the sword. She warned Arthur that the lake was guarded by a powerful monster, and that he must be careful.\n\nArthur thanked the old woman and set out for the lake. When he arrived, he saw that the lake was dark and eerie. He could see the outline of a monster lurking in the depths of the lake.\n\nArthur took a deep breath and dove into the water. He swam down to the bottom of the lake, where he saw the sword lying on a rock.\n\nArthur grabbed the sword and pulled it from the rock. As soon as he did, the monster emerged from the depths of the lake and attacked him.\n\nArthur fought the monster with all his strength, but he was no match for the creature.

            "Once upon a time, there was a young prince named Arthur who lived in a kingdom called Camelot. Arthur was the son of King Uther Pendragon and Lady Igraine. After his father's death, Arthur was crowned king of Camelot.\n\nArthur was a brave and just king, and his kingdom prospered under his rule. However, there was one thing that Arthur desired above all else: the legendary sword Excalibur.\n\nOne day, Arthur heard a story about a magical sword that was hidden in a lake. The sword was said to be so powerful that it could only be drawn by the true king of Camelot.\n\nArthur set out on a quest to find the sword. He traveled far and wide, but he could not find the lake where the sword was said to be hidden.\n\nFinally, Arthur came to a small village on the outskirts of Camelot. There, he met an old woman who told him that the lake where the sword was hidden was nearby.\n\nThe old woman told Arthur that he must take a boat to the lake and then dive into the water to find the sword. She warned Arthur that the lake was guarded by a powerful monster, and that he must be careful.\n\nArthur thanked the old woman and set out for the lake. When he arrived, he saw that the lake was dark and eerie. He could see the outline of a monster lurking in the depths of the lake.\n\nArthur took a deep breath and dove into the water.

            "Once upon a time, there was a young prince named Arthur who lived in a kingdom called Camelot. Arthur was the son of King Uther Pendragon and Lady Igraine. After his father's death, Arthur was crowned king of Camelot.\n\nArthur was a brave and just king, and his kingdom prospered under his rule. However, there was one thing that Arthur desired above all else: the legendary sword Excalibur.\n\nOne day, Arthur heard a story about a magical sword that was hidden in a lake. The sword was said to be so powerful that it could only be drawn by the true king of Camelot.\n\nArthur set out on a quest to find the sword. He traveled far and wide, but he could not find the lake where the sword was said to be hidden.\n\nFinally, Arthur came to a small village on the outskirts of Camelot. There, he met an old woman who told him that the lake where the sword was hidden was nearby.\n\nThe old woman told Arthur that he must take a boat to the lake and then dive into the water to find the sword. She warned Arthur that the lake was guarded by a powerful monster, and that he must be careful.\n\nArthur thanked the old woman and set out for the lake. When he arrived, he saw that the lake was dark and eerie. He could see the outline of a monster lurking in the depths of the lake.\n\nArthur took a deep breath and dove into the water. He swam down to the bottom of the lake, where he saw the sword lying on a rock.\n\nArthur grabbed the sword and pulled it from the rock. As soon as he did, the monster emerged from the depths of the lake and attacked him.\n\nArthur fought the monster with all his strength, but he was no match for the creature. Just when it looked like Arthur was about to be defeated, the old woman appeared and helped him defeat the monster.\n\nArthur was grateful to the old woman for her help.

            "Once upon a time, there was a young prince named Arthur who lived in a kingdom called Camelot. Arthur was the son of King Uther Pendragon and Lady Igraine. After his father's death, Arthur was crowned king of Camelot.\n\nArthur was a brave and just king, and his kingdom prospered under his rule. However, there was one thing that Arthur desired above all else: the legendary sword Excalibur.\n\nOne day, Arthur heard a story about a magical sword that was hidden in a lake. The sword was said to be so powerful that it could only be drawn by the true king of Camelot.\n\nArthur set out on a quest to find the sword. He traveled far and wide, but he could not find the lake where the sword was said to be hidden.\n\nFinally, Arthur came to a small village on the outskirts of Camelot. There, he met an old woman who told him that the lake where the sword was hidden was nearby.\n\nThe old woman told Arthur that he must take a boat to the lake and then dive into the water to find the sword. She warned Arthur that the lake was guarded by a powerful monster, and that he must be careful.\n\nArthur thanked the old woman and set out for the lake. When he arrived, he saw that the lake was dark and eerie. He could see the outline of a monster lurking in the depths of the lake.\n\nArthur took a deep breath and dove into the water. He swam down to the bottom of the lake, where he saw the sword lying on a rock.\n\nArthur grabbed the sword and pulled it from the rock. As soon as he did, the monster emerged from the depths of the lake and attacked him.\n\nArthur fought the monster with all his strength, but he was no match for the creature. Just when it looked like Arthur was about to be defeated, the old woman appeared and helped him defeat the monster.\n\nArthur was grateful to the old woman for her help. He thanked her and then set out for Camelot with the sword.\n\nWhen Arthur arrived in Camelot, he was hailed as a hero. He was crowned king of Camelot and the people celebrated his victory.\n\nArthur was a brave and just king, and his kingdom prospered under his rule.

            "Once upon a time, there was a young prince named Arthur who lived in a kingdom called Camelot. Arthur was the son of King Uther Pendragon and Lady Igraine. After his father's death, Arthur was crowned king of Camelot.\n\nArthur was a brave and just king, and his kingdom prospered under his rule. However, there was one thing that Arthur desired above all else: the legendary sword Excalibur.\n\nOne day, Arthur heard a story about a magical sword that was hidden in a lake. The sword was said to be so powerful that it could only be drawn by the true king of Camelot.\n\nArthur set out on a quest to find the sword. He traveled far and wide, but he could not find the lake where the sword was said to be hidden.\n\nFinally, Arthur came to a small village on the outskirts of Camelot. There, he met an old woman who told him that the lake where the sword was hidden was nearby.\n\nThe old woman told Arthur that he must take a boat to the lake and then dive into the water to find the sword. She warned Arthur that the lake was guarded by a powerful monster, and that he must be careful.\n\nArthur thanked the old woman and set out for the lake. When he arrived, he saw that the lake was dark and eerie. He could see the outline of a monster lurking in the depths of the lake.\n\nArthur took a deep breath and dove into the water. He swam down to the bottom of the lake, where he saw the sword lying on a rock.\n\nArthur grabbed the sword and pulled it from the rock. As soon as he did, the monster emerged from the depths of the lake and attacked him.\n\nArthur fought the monster with all his strength, but he was no match for the creature. Just when it looked like Arthur was about to be defeated, the old woman appeared and helped him defeat the monster.\n\nArthur was grateful to the old woman for her help. He thanked her and then set out for Camelot with the sword.\n\nWhen Arthur arrived in Camelot, he was hailed as a hero. He was crowned king of Camelot and the people celebrated his victory.\n\nArthur was a brave and just king, and his kingdom prospered under his rule.

After his father's death, Arthur was crowned king of Camelot.\n\nArthur was a brave and just king, and his kingdom prospered under his rule. However, there was one thing that Arthur desired above all else: the legendary sword Excalibur.\n\nOne day, Arthur heard a story about a magical sword that was hidden in a lake. The sword was said to be so powerful that it could only be drawn by the true king of Camelot.\n\nArthur set out on a quest to find the sword. He traveled far and wide, but he could not find the lake where the sword was said to be hidden.\n\nFinally, Arthur came to a small village on the outskirts of Camelot. There, he met an old woman who told him that the lake where the sword was hidden was nearby.\n\nThe old woman told Arthur that he must take a boat to the lake and then dive into the water to find the sword. She warned Arthur that the lake was guarded by a powerful monster, and that he must be careful.\n\nArthur thanked the old woman and set out for the lake. When he arrived, he saw that the lake was dark and eerie. He could see the outline of a monster lurking in the depths of the lake.\n\nArthur took a deep breath and dove into the water. He swam down to the bottom of the lake, where he saw the sword lying on a rock.\n\nArthur grabbed the sword and pulled it from the rock. As soon as he did, the monster emerged from the depths of the lake and attacked him.\n\nArthur fought the monster with all his strength, but he was no match for the creature. Just when it looked like Arthur was about to be defeated, the old woman appeared and helped him defeat the monster.\n\nArthur was grateful to the old woman for her help. He thanked her and then set out for Camelot with the sword.\n\nWhen Arthur arrived in Camelot, he was hailed as a hero. He was crowned king of Camelot and the people celebrated his victory.\n\nArthur was a brave and just king, and his kingdom prospered under his rule. He ruled Camelot for many years, and the people were happy and prosperous.\n\nBut then, one day, Arthur received a message from the wizard Merlin. Merlin told Arthur that he had been sent by the gods to warn him of a great danger that was coming.\n\nArthur was worried, but he knew that he must face this danger. He gathered his knights and they set out to find the source of the danger.\n\nThey traveled far and wide, but they could not find the source of the danger. Finally, they came to a small village on the outskirts of Camelot. There, they met an old woman who told them that the danger was coming from a dragon.\n\nThe dragon was called Smaug, and he was a powerful beast who lived in a mountain on the outskirts of Camelot. He was angry with Arthur because he had taken his magic sword, Excalibur.\n\nArthur and his knights set out to find Smaug and stop him from causing the danger. They traveled to his mountain and confronted him.\n\nSmaug was angry and powerful, but Arthur and his knights were brave and determined. They fought Smaug and his magic, and they finally defeated him.\n\nThe danger stopped and the people of Camelot rejoiced. Arthur was hailed as a hero once again, and he ruled Camelot for many more years.\n\nBut then, one day, Arthur received a message from the wizard Merlin.

After his father's death, Arthur was crowned king of Camelot.\n\nArthur was a brave and just king, and his kingdom prospered under his rule. However, there was one thing that Arthur desired above all else: the legendary sword Excalibur.\n\nOne day, Arthur heard a story about a magical sword that was hidden in a lake. The sword was said to be so powerful that it could only be drawn by the true king of Camelot.\n\nArthur set out on a quest to find the sword. He traveled far and wide, but he could not find the lake where the sword was said to be hidden.\n\nFinally, Arthur came to a small village on the outskirts of Camelot.

She warned Arthur that the lake was guarded by a powerful monster, and that he must be careful.\n\nArthur thanked the old woman and set out for the lake. When he arrived, he saw that the lake was dark and eerie. He could see the outline of a monster lurking in the depths of the lake.\n\nArthur took a deep breath and dove into the water.

After his father's death, Arthur was crowned king of Camelot.\n\nArthur was a brave and just king, and his kingdom prospered under his rule. However, there was one thing that Arthur desired above all else: the legendary sword Excalibur.\n\nOne day, Arthur heard a story about a magical sword that was hidden in a lake. The sword was said to be so powerful that it could only be drawn by the true king of Camelot.\n\nArthur set out on a quest to find the sword.

            "Once upon a time, there was a young prince named Arthur who lived in a kingdom called Camelot. Arthur was the son of King Uther Pendragon and Lady Igraine. After his father's death, Arthur was crowned king of Camelot.\n\nArthur was a brave and just king, and his kingdom prospered under his rule. However, there was one thing that Arthur desired above all else: the legendary sword Excalibur.\n\nOne day, Arthur heard a story about a magical sword that was hidden in a lake. The sword was said to be so powerful that it could only be drawn by the true king of Camelot.\n\nArthur set out on a quest to find the sword. He traveled far and wide, but he could not find the lake where the sword was said to be hidden.\n\nFinally, Arthur came to a small village on the outskirts of Camelot. There, he met an old woman who told him that the lake where the sword was hidden was nearby.\n\nThe old woman told Arthur that he must take a boat to the lake and then dive into the water to find the sword. She warned Arthur that the lake was guarded by a powerful monster, and that he must be careful.\n\nArthur thanked the old woman and set out for the lake. When he arrived, he saw that the lake was dark and eerie. He could see the outline of a monster lurking in the depths of the lake.\n\nArthur took a deep breath and dove into the water. He swam down to the bottom of the lake, where he saw the sword lying on a rock.\n\nArthur grabbed the sword and pulled it from the rock. As soon as he did, the monster emerged from the depths of the lake and attacked him.\n\nArthur fought the monster with all his strength, but he was no match for the creature.

He thanked her and then set out for Camelot with the sword.\n\nWhen Arthur arrived in Camelot, he was hailed as a hero.

            "Once upon a time, there was a young prince named Arthur who lived in a kingdom called Camelot. Arthur was the son of King Uther Pendragon and Lady Igraine. After his father's death, Arthur was crowned king of Camelot.\n\nArthur was a brave and just king, and his kingdom prospered under his rule. However, there was one thing that Arthur desired above all else: the legendary sword Excalibur.\n\nOne day, Arthur heard a story about a magical sword that was hidden in a lake. The sword was said to be so powerful that it could only be drawn by the true king of Camelot.\n\nArthur set out on a quest to find the sword. He traveled far and wide, but he could not find the lake where the sword was said to be hidden.\n\nFinally, Arthur came to a small village on the outskirts of Camelot. There, he met an old woman who told him that the lake where the sword was hidden was nearby.\n\nThe old woman told Arthur that he must take a boat to the lake and then dive into the water to find the sword. She warned Arthur that the lake was guarded by a powerful monster, and that he must be careful.\n\nArthur thanked the old woman and set out for the lake. When he arrived, he saw that the lake was dark and eerie. He could see the outline of a monster lurking in the depths of the lake.\n\nArthur took a deep breath and dove into the water. He swam down to the bottom of the lake, where he saw the sword lying on a rock.\n\nArthur grabbed the sword and pulled it from the rock. As soon as he did, the monster emerged from the depths of the lake and attacked him.\n\nArthur fought the monster with all his strength, but he was no match for the creature. Just when it looked like Arthur was about to be defeated, the old woman appeared and helped him defeat the monster.\n\nArthur was grateful to the old woman for her help. He thanked her and then set out for Camelot with the sword.\n\nWhen Arthur arrived in Camelot, he was hailed as a hero.

            "Once upon a time, there was a young prince named Arthur who lived in a kingdom called Camelot. Arthur was the son of King Uther Pendragon and Lady Igraine. After his father's death, Arthur was crowned king of Camelot.\n\nArthur was a brave and just king, and his kingdom prospered under his rule. However, there was one thing that Arthur desired above all else: the legendary sword Excalibur.\n\nOne day, Arthur heard a story about a magical sword that was hidden in a lake. The sword was said to be so powerful that it could only be drawn by the true king of Camelot.\n\nArthur set out on a quest to find the sword. He traveled far and wide, but he could not find the lake where the sword was said to be hidden.\n\nFinally, Arthur came to a small village on the outskirts of Camelot. There, he met an old woman who told him that the lake where the sword was hidden was nearby.\n\nThe old woman told Arthur that he must take a boat to the lake and then dive into the water to find the sword. She warned Arthur that the lake was guarded by a powerful monster, and that he must be careful.\n\nArthur thanked the old woman and set out for the lake. When he arrived, he saw that the lake was dark and eerie. He could see the outline of a monster lurking in the depths of the lake.\n\nArthur took a deep breath and dove into the water. He swam down to the bottom of the lake, where he saw the sword lying on a rock.\n\nArthur grabbed the sword and pulled it from the rock. As soon as he did, the monster emerged from the depths of the lake and attacked him.\n\nArthur fought the monster with all his strength, but he was no match for the creature. Just when it looked like Arthur was about to be defeated, the old woman appeared and helped him defeat the monster.\n\nArthur was grateful to the old woman for her help. He thanked her and then set out for Camelot with the sword.\n\nWhen Arthur arrived in Camelot, he was hailed as a hero.

            "Once upon a time, there was a young prince named Arthur who lived in a kingdom called Camelot. Arthur was the son of King Uther Pendragon and Lady Igraine. After his father's death, Arthur was crowned king of Camelot.\n\nArthur was a brave and just king, and his kingdom prospered under his rule. However, there was one thing that Arthur desired above all else: the legendary sword Excalibur.\n\nOne day, Arthur heard a story about a magical sword that was hidden in a lake. The sword was said to be so powerful that it could only be drawn by the true king of Camelot.\n\nArthur set out on a quest to find the sword. He traveled far and wide, but he could not find the lake where the sword was said to be hidden.\n\nFinally, Arthur came to a small village on the outskirts of Camelot. There, he met an old woman who told him that the lake where the sword was hidden was nearby.\n\nThe old woman told Arthur that he must take a boat to the lake and then dive into the water to find the sword. She warned Arthur that the lake was guarded by a powerful monster, and that he must be careful.\n\nArthur thanked the old woman and set out for the lake. When he arrived, he saw that the lake was dark and eerie. He could see the outline of a monster lurking in the depths of the lake.\n\nArthur took a deep breath and dove into the water. He swam down to the bottom of the lake, where he saw the sword lying on a rock.\n\nArthur grabbed the sword and pulled it from the rock. As soon as he did, the monster emerged from the depths of the lake and attacked him.\n\nArthur fought the monster with all his strength, but he was no match for the creature. Just when it looked like Arthur was about to be defeated, the old woman appeared and helped him defeat the monster.\n\nArthur was grateful to the old woman for her help. He thanked her and then set out for Camelot with the sword.\n\nWhen Arthur arrived in Camelot, he was hailed as a hero.

            "Once upon a time, there was a young prince named Arthur who lived in a kingdom called Camelot. Arthur was the son of King Uther Pendragon and Lady Igraine. After his father's death, Arthur was crowned king of Camelot.\n\nArthur was a brave and just king, and his kingdom prospered under his rule. However, there was one thing that Arthur desired above all else: the legendary sword Excalibur.\n\nOne day, Arthur heard a story about a magical sword that was hidden in a lake. The sword was said to be so powerful that it could only be drawn by the true king of Camelot.\n\nArthur set out on a quest to find the sword. He traveled far and wide, but he could not find the lake where the sword was said to be hidden.\n\nFinally, Arthur came to a small village on the outskirts of Camelot. There, he met an old woman who told him that the lake where the sword was hidden was nearby.\n\nThe old woman told Arthur that he must take a boat to the lake and then dive into the water to find the sword. She warned Arthur that the lake was guarded by a powerful monster, and that he must be careful.\n\nArthur thanked the old woman and set out for the lake. When he arrived, he saw that the lake was dark and eerie. He could see the outline of a monster lurking in the depths of the lake.\n\nArthur took a deep breath and dove into the water. He swam down to the bottom of the lake, where he saw the sword lying on a rock.\n\nArthur grabbed the sword and pulled it from the rock. As soon as he did, the monster emerged from the depths of the lake and attacked him.\n\nArthur fought the monster with all his strength, but he was no match for the creature. Just when it looked like Arthur was about to be defeated, the old woman appeared and helped him defeat the monster.\n\nArthur was grateful to the old woman for her help. He thanked her and then set out for Camelot with the sword.\n\nWhen Arthur arrived in Camelot, he was hailed as a hero. He was crowned king of Camelot and the people celebrated his victory.\n\nArthur was a brave and just king, and his kingdom prospered under his rule.
