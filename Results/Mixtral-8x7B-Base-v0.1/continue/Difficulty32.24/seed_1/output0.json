The paper also outlines the parameters and typological proposals to define and demarcate these resources. These parameters and proposals are based on the function and purpose of the resources. The paper also outlines the object of study of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography.\n\nMultilingual lexicography is the study of multiple languages in a lexicographical context. This includes the study of how to represent multiple languages in a single lexicographical resource, as well as the study of how to represent multiple languages in multiple lexicographical resources. Plurilingual lexicography is the study of multiple languages in a lexicographical context, with a focus on how to represent multiple languages in a single lexicographical resource.\n\nElectronic lexicographical resources are typically classified according to their function and purpose. The most common types of electronic lexicographical resources are dictionaries, thesauri, and encyclopedias. Each of these types of resources has its own advantages and disadvantages.\n\nDictionaries are the most common type of electronic lexicographical resource. Dictionaries typically provide definitions of words, as well as information about the etymology of words. Dictionaries are typically designed for use by native speakers of a language.\n\nThesauri are another common type of electronic lexicographical resource. Thesauri typically provide synonyms and antonyms for words, as well as information about the usage of words. Thesauri are typically designed for use by non-native speakers of a language.\n\nEncyclopedias are the third common type of electronic lexicographical resource. Encyclopedias typically provide information about a wide variety of topics, including history, science, and culture. Encyclopedias are typically designed for use by both native and non-native speakers of a language.\n\nThe advantages of electronic lexicographical resources are that they are typically easy to use and are often available for free. The disadvantages of electronic lexicographical resources are that they are often incomplete and are not always accurate.\n\nThe parameters and typological proposals to define and demarcate electronic lexicographical resources are based on the function and purpose of the resources. The parameters and proposals are designed to help lexicographers to determine which resources are appropriate for a particular purpose.\n\nThe object of study of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography is to provide access to information about multiple languages. This information can be used to help users to understand and use these languages. The object of study of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography is also to help users to understand the relationships between multiple languages.\n\nThe paper concludes that multilingual and plurilingual electronic lexicographic resources are important tools for lexicographers and language learners. These resources provide access to information about multiple languages and help users to understand and use these languages. The paper recommends that further research be conducted on these resources in order to better understand their role in lexicography."
