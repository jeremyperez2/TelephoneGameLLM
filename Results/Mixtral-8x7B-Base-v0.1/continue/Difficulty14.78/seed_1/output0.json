            "## Introduction\n\nIn this paper, we implement and compare both classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) by testing their losses and prediction accuracy on three commonly used datasets: MNIST hand-written digits, Fashion MNIST, and Cat/Dog Face images. Additionally, we also implement data augmentation (DA) in QCNNs to improve their performance.\n\n## Data Augmentation in QCNNs\n\nWe find that data augmentation improves the performance of QCNNs. We analyze the reasons behind this result and find that there are two possible explanations. Firstly, data augmentation introduces noise in the training process, which makes it easier for QCNNs to process the data efficiently and properly. Secondly, the quantum mechanisms in QCNNs are suitable for the high-dimensional images used in this paper. Therefore, the performance of QCNNs is better than that of CNNs without DA.\n\n## Results\n\nWe conclude that data augmentation is a useful tool for improving the performance of QCNNs, and that the quantum mechanisms in QCNNs are suitable for high-dimensional images. Additionally, we find that the quantum mechanisms in QCNNs are suitable for the high-dimensional images used in this paper. Therefore, the performance of QCNNs is better than that of CNNs without DA. Additionally, QCNNs have the advantage of reducing the size of input from n to log2n."
