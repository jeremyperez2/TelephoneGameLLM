Empirical evaluations on a public dataset of cerebral palsy patients indicate that the proposed framework surpasses current state-of-the-art approaches and show significant improvements in predicting general gait parameters (including walking speed, gait deviation index - gdi, and knee flexion angle at maximum extension). The proposed framework utilizes fewer parameters and alleviates the need for manual feature extraction, making it more efficient and accessible for clinical gait analysis.\n\nThe research highlights the potential of leveraging deep learning and computer vision to improve clinical gait analysis, reducing the dependence on expensive motion capture systems and manual feature extraction. The proposed framework provides a cost-effective and efficient alternative for early diagnosis and treatment of musculoskeletal diseases and cognitive impairments in patients. The introduction of a novel spatiotemporal transformer network to estimate critical gait parameters from rgb videos captured by a single-view camera shows significant improvements in the field of gait analysis.\n\nHowever, one limitation of the proposed framework is that it only considers the rgb video data and does not take into account other modalities such as depth or inertial data, which could potentially improve the accuracy of the gait analysis. Additionally, the evaluation of the proposed framework is limited to a single dataset, and further testing on other datasets is necessary to validate its effectiveness across a wider range of scenarios. Nevertheless, the proposed framework has the potential to significantly improve the field of clinical gait analysis and provide a cost-effective and efficient alternative for early diagnosis and treatment of musculoskeletal diseases and cognitive impairments in patients.\n\nOne potential area for further research is to investigate the use of other types of data, such as depth or inertial data, in conjunction with rgb video data to improve the accuracy of the gait analysis. Additionally, the proposed framework could be tested on other datasets to validate its effectiveness across a wider range of scenarios and patient populations.
