However, further research is needed to enhance the accuracy of the predictions and generalize the approach to other patient populations. The study also suggests that the proposed framework may be useful in developing more personalized and cost-effective treatments for patients with musculoskeletal diseases and cognitive impairments.\n\nThe current study has several limitations that need to be addressed in future research. Firstly, the study only evaluated the proposed framework on a public dataset of cerebral palsy patients, and further studies are needed to validate the generalizability of the framework to other patient populations. Secondly, the study used a single-view RGB camera to capture the gait data, which may limit the accuracy of the predictions in complex environments. Future studies should consider using multi-view cameras or other sensors to capture more accurate and detailed gait data.\n\nThirdly, the study only evaluated the accuracy of the proposed framework in predicting general gait parameters such as walking speed, GDI, and knee flexion angle at maximum extension. However, these parameters may not be sufficient to fully characterize the gait patterns of individual patients.

            "The field of gait analysis has undergone significant advancements in recent years, thanks to the advancements in computer vision and deep learning. Traditional clinical gait analysis heavily relied on expensive optical motion capture systems, which limited accessibility and added to the cost of treatment. However, recent studies have demonstrated the potential of cost-effective alternatives such as RGB videos captured by a single-view camera.\n\nThe proposed spatio-temporal transformer network in this study aims to predict critical gait parameters from RGB videos, which is a more accessible and cost-effective alternative to traditional optical motion capture systems. The empirical evaluations on a public dataset of cerebral palsy patients have shown that the proposed framework surpasses current state-of-the-art approaches and demonstrates significant improvements in predicting general gait parameters, including walking speed, gait deviation index (GDI), and knee flexion angle at maximum extension, while utilizing fewer parameters and alleviating the need for manual feature extraction.\n\nHowever, the proposed framework has several limitations that need to be addressed in future research. Firstly, the study only evaluated the proposed framework on a public dataset of cerebral palsy patients, and further studies are needed to validate the generalizability of the framework to other patient populations. Secondly, the study used a single-view RGB camera to capture the gait data, which may limit the accuracy of the predictions in complex environments. Future studies should consider using multi-view cameras or other sensors to capture more accurate and detailed gait data.\n\nThirdly, the study only evaluated the accuracy of the proposed framework in predicting general gait parameters such as walking speed, GDI, and knee flexion angle at maximum extension. However, these parameters may not be sufficient to fully characterize the gait patterns of individual patients. Future studies should explore the potential of the proposed framework in predicting more specific gait parameters such as joint angles, ground reaction forces, and muscle activation patterns.\n\nFinally, the proposed framework only utilized RGB videos as input, which may limit its applicability to patients with visual impairments. Future studies should explore the potential of using other modalities such as audio or tactile sensors to capture gait data from patients with visual impairments.\n\nIn conclusion, the proposed spatio-temporal transformer network shows promising results in predicting critical gait parameters from RGB videos.

However, more research is needed to fully understand the potential of the proposed framework in improving the diagnosis and treatment of gait disorders. Additionally, the study recommends exploring the use of other modalities such as audio or tactile sensors to make the framework more accessible to patients with visual impairments.\n\nOverall, the study presents a promising alternative to traditional clinical gait analysis methods and highlights the potential of deep learning techniques in advancing the field of gait analysis.
