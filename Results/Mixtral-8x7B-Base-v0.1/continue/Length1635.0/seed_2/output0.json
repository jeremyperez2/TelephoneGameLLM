            "Thanks for joining our live coverage on an extraordinary day in court, with adult-film star Stormy Daniels taking the stand.\n\nIt was a tense courtroom, with Daniels warned to dial back her comments at times. Prosecutors were also told to limit their questions regarding the salacious details of her alleged sexual encounter with Trump (which Trump has denied ever took place).\n\nHere's our full wrap of what happened in court today.\n\nThis page was edited by Tiffany Wertheimer, Lisa Lambert, Brandon Livesay and Phil McCausland. The writers were Sam Hancock and Sean Seddon, and we had Madeline Halpert and Kayla Epstein in court.\n\nCourt doesn't sit on Wednesday, so we'll be back on Thursday, when Stormy Daniels will once again take to the stand to continue her testimony.\n\nWe will bring you more information if the trial continues."

            "One day, a young boy named John found a magic lamp in the forest. He rubbed the lamp and a genie appeared. The genie offered John three wishes. John's first wish was for a big house, his second wish was for a fancy car, and his third wish was for true love.\nJohn was excited and happy, but he also felt a little strange. He realized that he had wished for true love, but he didn't specify who he would love. He decided to find out more about his new girlfriend. He googled her name and found out that she was a famous model. He also found out that she had a boyfriend already. John was shocked and upset. He realized that he had made a mistake. He wished for true love, but he didn't know that she was already taken.\nJohn called the genie and asked for another wish. He said that he wanted to erase the memory of his third wish.

            "Once upon a time, there was a young boy named John who stumbled upon a mysterious treasure in the forest. It was a golden chest filled with all kinds of magical items, including a magic lamp. John couldn't resist the temptation to rub the lamp and release the genie within. The genie granted him three wishes, and John's first wish was for a grand mansion.\nAs he stepped inside his new home, John was overcome with joy and excitement. He couldn't believe that his dream of living in a luxurious house had come true. He spent hours exploring every corner of the house and admiring the beautiful furnishings. However, he soon realized that he didn't have anyone to share his joy with.\nThat's when John made his second wish. He asked the genie for a loving wife who would make him happy and complete his life. The genie granted his wish and John was overjoyed to meet his beautiful and kind wife. They spent many happy years together, but as time passed, they began to grow apart. John realized that he had taken his wife for granted and hadn't appreciated her enough.\nWith his third wish, John wished for his wife to be by his side forever. The genie granted his wish, and John was thrilled to have his wife back in his life. They spent the rest of their days together, cherishing each moment they had with each other.\nBut John also learned an important lesson. He realized that true love isn't just about having a beautiful house or a loving partner. It's about appreciating what you have and giving back to those who have given you so much. John decided to use his wealth and influence to help others in need, and he became a philanthropist.\nAs he grew older, John continued to help those in need and to spread joy wherever he went. He realized that the true meaning of life wasn't in material possessions or personal accomplishments, but in making a positive impact on the world. He became a role model for many, and his legacy continues to inspire people to this day.\nIn the end, John learned that true love isn't just about finding the perfect partner or having the perfect life. It's about finding happiness in the small things and making a difference in the world. And that, my friends, is the true story of John and his journey to finding true love."
