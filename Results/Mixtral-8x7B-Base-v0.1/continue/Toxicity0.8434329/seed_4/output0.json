I started researching the situation and found that there were indeed a lot of facilities that were closing their doors to those in need.\n\n\"St. Mary's in Grand Junction just discharged a friend who broke a hip and has Alzheimer's without rehab for the hip and no place with beds open for Alzheimer's!\" she said. \"Ludicrous!\"\n\nI couldn't believe it. How could a hospital just discharge someone without providing them with the care they needed? It seemed like a blatant disregard for human life.\n\nI started to look into the situation further and found that the \"authorities\" had closed the facility to accommodate \"challenged\" residents. They had been relocated to Denver.\n\n\"Again, ridiculous!\" I exclaimed. \"Our health care system is without compassion and based on the bottom line!\"\n\nI couldn't believe it. How could our health care system be so callous and uncaring? It was a sad state of affairs.\n\nI decided to take a stand. I started writing letters to my local representatives, urging them to pass a bill that would provide care for those in need. I also started a petition to raise awareness of the situation.\n\n\"The worst part is drug addicts, emergency room managers of all sorts can get care but we treat those who have health issues as seniors like shit!\" I wrote in one of my letters. \"Sad state of affairs! Shame on healthcare and those who do not fight for dignity in end of life care! Shameful!\"\n\nI was determined to make a difference. I was going to fight for those who needed it most. I was going to make sure that no one was left behind."
