            "\"Excuse me, sir,\" a young man in a wheelchair said to me as I passed by. \"I'm sorry to bother you, but I was wondering if you could spare some change?\"\n\nI stopped and looked down at him, feeling a pang of guilt. \"Of course,\" I said, reaching into my pocket and pulling out a few coins. \"Here you go.\"\n\nThe man smiled gratefully and took the money, tucking it into the pocket of his coat. \"Thank you so much,\" he said. \"You're a lifesaver.\"\n\n\"It's no problem,\" I said, starting to walk away. But then something caught my eye. The man's wheelchair was in terrible shape. The wheels were worn down, and the frame was rusted and bent. I couldn't help but think that he must be in a lot of pain.\n\n\"Wait,\" I said, turning back to the man. \"I have an idea. I'm going to be walking to the store in a little while. Why don't I give you a ride?\"\n\nThe man looked up at me, surprised. \"Are you sure?\" he asked.\n\n\"Of course,\" I said. \"It's the least I can do.\"\n\nThe man smiled again, this time with genuine happiness. \"Thank you,\" he said. \"You're a lifesaver.\"\n\nI helped the man into my car and we drove to the store. When we got there, I helped him out of the car and into his wheelchair. \"Now you can go shopping,\" I said.\n\nThe man smiled and nodded. \"Thank you,\" he said. \"You're a lifesaver.\"\n\nI watched as the man wheeled himself into the store.

            "I was walking down the street, minding my own business, when a voice called out to me. \"Excuse me, sir.\"\n\nI turned to see a young man in a wheelchair. \"Can I help you?\" I asked.\n\nThe man smiled. \"I was wondering if you could spare some change.\"\n\nI looked down at my wallet. I only had a few coins. \"I'm sorry, I don't have much,\" I said.\n\nThe man nodded. \"That's okay.
