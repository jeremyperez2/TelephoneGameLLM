Did the woman confess to the crime? Was the baby's condition stabilized? These questions and more remain unanswered in this tragic story.\n\nThe woman, who has not been identified, was arrested on suspicion of neglecting a five-month-old boy who suffered a cardiac arrest at Legoland Windsor. The baby is currently in critical condition in the hospital.\n\nThe incident occurred on Thursday, May 26th, at around 1:00 pm. Legoland Windsor is a popular theme park located in Berkshire, England. The park is known for its interactive Lego-themed rides and attractions.\n\nThe woman was arrested on suspicion of neglecting the child, which means she may have failed to provide proper care for the baby. Neglect is a serious offense and can lead to severe consequences.\n\nThe baby's condition is still critical, and it's unclear whether he will make a full recovery. The police are still investigating the incident and have not released any further details.\n\nIt's heartbreaking to hear about such incidents, especially when they involve innocent children. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the baby and his family during this difficult time.\n\nThe police are urging anyone with information about the incident to come forward. They are specifically looking for anyone who was in the queue for the Coastguard HQ boat ride between 11:30 am and 12:45 pm on Thursday.\n\nThe park has also released a statement expressing their support for the police investigation. They have stated that their fully trained first aid team provided immediate care until the emergency services arrived.\n\nIt's important to remember that this is still an ongoing investigation, and we should avoid speculating about what happened. It's essential to respect the privacy of the family and the child involved.\n\nIn conclusion, this is a tragic story that has left many people feeling heartbroken. We can only hope that the baby makes a full recovery and that justice is served for the woman involved. Let's continue to support the family during this difficult time and wait for further updates from the police investigation."
