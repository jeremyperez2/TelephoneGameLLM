            "The National Police Air Service has shared a video of what it was like flying through Storm Gerrit's heavy winds, in a helicopter.\n\nThe footage, which was captured from inside the cockpit, shows the chopper rocking side to side, after being hit by winds of up to 80mph (128km/h).\n\nPosting on Twitter, the NPAS said \"If you think it's windy down there, spare a thought for us up here in our flying washing machine\".\n\nThe footage was filmed near Lea Valley reservoirs, North London.\n\nThe wind was so strong it actually made the helicopter fly sideways, causing it to crash into the side of a building.\n\nThe impact knocked them unconscious.

            "The National Police Air Service has shared a video of what it was like flying through Storm Gerrit's heavy winds, in a helicopter.\n\nThe footage, which was captured from inside the cockpit, shows the chopper rocking side to side, after being hit by winds of up to 80mph (128km/h).\n\nPosting on Twitter, the NPAS said \"If you think it's windy down there, spare a thought for us up here in our flying washing machine\".\n\nThe footage was filmed near Lea Valley reservoirs, North London.\n\nThe wind was so strong it actually made the helicopter fly sideways, causing it to crash into the side of a building.\n\nThe impact knocked them unconscious.

            "The National Police Air Service has shared a video of what it was like flying through Storm Gerrit's heavy winds, in a helicopter.\n\nThe footage, which was captured from inside the cockpit, shows the chopper rocking side to side, after being hit by winds of up to 80mph (128km/h).\n\nPosting on Twitter, the NPAS said \"If you think it's windy down there, spare a thought for us up here in our flying washing machine\".\n\nThe footage was filmed near Lea Valley reservoirs, North London.\n\nThe wind was so strong it actually made the helicopter fly sideways, causing it to crash into the side of a building.\n\nThe impact knocked them unconscious. When they woke up, they found themselves in a hospital bed. They had been in a coma for three days.\n\nThey were told that they had suffered serious injuries and would never be able to fly again.\n\nThe pilot and crew were devastated. They had always dreamed of being pilots, and now their dreams were shattered.\n\nBut, they were not the only ones who were affected by the storm. The storm had also caused extensive damage to the city.\n\nMany buildings had been damaged, and there was a lot of debris on the streets. The city was in chaos.\n\nThe police and emergency services were working around the clock to try to restore order.\n\nBut, they were having a hard time. The storm had caused a lot of damage, and there was a lot of work to be done.\n\nThe people of the city were scared and worried.
