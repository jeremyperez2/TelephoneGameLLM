            "Once upon a time, there was a young prince who was very handsome and very brave. He was the son of the king and queen, and he was loved by everyone in the kingdom. One day, the prince went for a walk in the forest, and he came across a beautiful young woman who was lost. The prince helped the young woman find her way home, and they fell in love.\n\nBut their happiness was short-lived, for the young woman was actually a witch in disguise. She had cast a spell on the prince, and he was now under her control. The witch forced the prince to do her bidding, and she made him steal from the king's treasury and commit other crimes.\n\nThe prince was ashamed of what he had done, but he was powerless to resist the witch's magic. Finally, the witch decided to get rid of the prince and take his place as ruler of the kingdom. She cast a spell on the prince, turning him into a frog. The frog was helpless, and the witch threw him into a pond and left him to die.\n\nBut the frog was not dead. He was able to swim to the edge of the pond and climb out. He made his way back to the castle, and he found the witch in the throne room, wearing the crown of the kingdom. The frog hopped up to the witch and kissed her on the cheek.\n\nThe witch was shocked, and she fell to the floor, dead.

            "Once upon a time, there was a young prince who was very handsome and very brave. He was the son of the king and queen, and he was loved by everyone in the kingdom. One day, the prince went for a walk in the forest, and he came across a beautiful young woman who was lost. The prince helped the young woman find her way home, and they fell in love.\n\nBut their happiness was short-lived, for the young woman was actually a witch in disguise. She had cast a spell on the prince, and he was now under her control. The witch forced the prince to do her bidding, and she made him steal from the king's treasury and commit other crimes.\n\nThe prince was ashamed of what he had done, but he was powerless to resist the witch's magic. Finally, the witch decided to get rid of the prince and take his place as ruler of the kingdom. She cast a spell on the prince, turning him into a frog. The frog was helpless, and the witch threw him into a pond and left him to die.\n\nBut the frog was not dead. He was able to swim to the edge of the pond and climb out.

            "Once upon a time, there was a young prince who was very handsome and very brave. He was the son of the king and queen, and he was loved by everyone in the kingdom. One day, the prince went for a walk in the forest, and he came across a beautiful young woman who was lost. The prince helped the young woman find her way home, and they fell in love.\n\nBut their happiness was short-lived, for the young woman was actually a witch in disguise. She had cast a spell on the prince, and he was now under her control. The witch forced the prince to do her bidding, and she made him steal from the king's treasury and commit other crimes.\n\nThe prince was ashamed of what he had done, but he was powerless to resist the witch's magic. Finally, the witch decided to get rid of the prince and take his place as ruler of the kingdom. She cast a spell on the prince, turning him into a frog.

One day, the prince went for a walk in the forest, and he came across a beautiful young woman who was lost. The prince helped the young woman find her way home, and they fell in love.\n\nBut their happiness was short-lived, for the young woman was actually a witch in disguise. She had cast a spell on the prince, and he was now under her control. The witch forced the prince to do her bidding, and she made him steal from the king's treasury and commit other crimes.\n\nThe prince was ashamed of what he had done, but he was powerless to resist the witch's magic.

            "Once upon a time, there was a young prince who was very handsome and very brave. He was the son of the king and queen, and he was loved by everyone in the kingdom. One day, the prince went for a walk in the forest, and he came across a beautiful young woman who was lost. The prince helped the young woman find her way home, and they fell in love.\n\nBut their happiness was short-lived, for the young woman was actually a witch in disguise. She had cast a spell on the prince, and he was now under her control. The witch forced the prince to do her bidding, and she made him steal from the king's treasury and commit other crimes.\n\nThe prince was ashamed of what he had done, but he was powerless to resist the witch's magic. Finally, the witch decided to get rid of the prince and take his place as ruler of the kingdom. She cast a spell on the prince, turning him into a frog. The frog was helpless, and the witch threw him into a pond and left him to die.\n\nBut the frog was not dead. He was able to swim to the edge of the pond and climb out.

One day, the prince went for a walk in the forest, and he came across a beautiful young woman who was lost. The prince helped the young woman find her way home, and they fell in love.\n\nBut their happiness was short-lived, for the young woman was actually a witch in disguise.
