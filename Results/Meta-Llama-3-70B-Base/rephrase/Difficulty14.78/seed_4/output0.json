In this paper, both CNNs and QCNNs are implemented and compared using losses and prediction accuracy on three commonly used datasets: the MNIST handwritten digits, Fashion MNIST, and Cat/Dog face images. Data augmentation (DA), a technique used in CNNs to improve the performance of classification by generating similar images based on original inputs, was also implemented in QCNNs. Surprisingly, the results showed that data augmentation did not improve QCNNs performance. The reasons and logic behind this result are discussed in order to expand our understanding of quantum machine learning theory."

            "Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs) have recently gained much popularity due to their ability to accurately recognize images. QCNNs utilize quantum mechanics to reduce the size of the input from n to log2n, thus reducing the amount of training required. In this paper, both CNNs and QCNNs were implemented and compared using losses and prediction accuracy on three commonly used datasets: MNIST handwritten digits, Fashion MNIST, and Cat/Dog face images.
