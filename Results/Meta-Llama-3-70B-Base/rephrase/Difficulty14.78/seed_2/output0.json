CNNs consist of multiple layers of interconnected artificial neurons, which process input data to identify patterns and features in images. The efficiency of CNNs can be improved by using quantum computing, which relies on quantum mechanics. Studies have shown that by reducing the input size from n to log2n, model training can be made more efficient using quantum computing. However, our findings suggest that data augmentation, a technique used to improve the performance of CNNs by generating similar images from the original inputs, did not enhance the performance of quantum CNNs (QCNNs).
