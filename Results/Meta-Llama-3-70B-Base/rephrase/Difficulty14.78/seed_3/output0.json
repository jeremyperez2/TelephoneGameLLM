            "Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs) have recently been introduced as a generalization of classical Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). QCNNs use quantum mechanics instead of classical mechanics, which leads to more efficient training due to the reduction in input size from $n$ to $\\log_2 n$. In this paper, both classical CNNs and QCNNs are implemented and compared by testing losses and prediction accuracies on three commonly used datasets: MNIST handwritten digits dataset, Fashion MNIST dataset, and cat/dog face image dataset. Additionally, Data Augmentation (DA), a technique commonly used in classical CNNs to improve classification performance by generating similar images from original inputs, is implemented in QCNNs. However, contrary to expectations, DA did not improve the performance of QCNNs. The reasons and logic behind this result are discussed to expand our understanding of quantum machine learning theory."

            "In conventional neural networks, each neuron receives input from multiple other neurons and performs a weighted sum of these inputs before passing the result through an activation function to determine the output. This process is repeated for each neuron in the network, creating a complex network of connections that can be used to make predictions or classify data.\n\nHowever, this approach can be memory-intensive, as the number of connections between neurons grows rapidly as the size of the network increases. For example, a network with N neurons will have N(N-1)/2 connections, which can quickly become prohibitive for large networks. This can be especially problematic when working with large datasets, as each neuron must store the weights for all of its connections, which can quickly exhaust the available memory.\n\nQuantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) offer a solution to this problem by using a different approach to processing input data. Instead of creating a complex network of connections between neurons, QCNNs use a series of convolutional layers to process the input data. Convolutional layers are a type of layer commonly used in conventional neural networks, where the input is processed by a series of filters that extract specific features from the data.\n\nThe key difference between conventional convolutional layers and those used in QCNNs is the way in which the filters are applied. In conventional convolutional layers, the filters are applied to the input data in a sliding window, where each filter is applied to a small portion of the input data at a time. This means that the input data must be processed multiple times in order to extract all of the relevant features.\n\nHowever, in QCNNs, the filters are applied to the input data using a quantum mechanical process known as quantum Fourier transform (QFT). This process allows the filters to be applied to the input data in parallel, rather than in a sliding window, which significantly reduces the amount of input data that needs to be processed.
