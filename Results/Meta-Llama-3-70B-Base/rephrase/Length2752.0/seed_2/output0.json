            "On May 2, 2023, a US Army soldier was arrested in Vladivostok, Russia while visiting a friend. The Russian Foreign Ministry stated that the charges against him were not related to spying or political issues, but rather a \"serious internal offense.\" The US Army revealed that the soldier had served in Iraq in 2009 and Afghanistan in 2013, but did not have permission to travel to China and Russia. It is unknown whether he intended to remain in Russia. The Russian Interior Ministry informed the US embassy in Moscow of the soldier's arrest for theft of personal property on May 2nd. He is currently being held in a pre-trial detention facility awaiting his next court hearing. The US Army has notified his family and the US State Department is providing necessary consular assistance to the soldier in Russia. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby confirmed that the US is \"aware of this case and other matters related to Russia.\" Mr. Kirby said he could not provide further details at the White House briefing on Monday. Russia is currently holding two other Americans: Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who has been detained since March 2023 on espionage charges, and former US Marine Paul Whelan, who was convicted of spying and sentenced to 16 years in prison in 2020. Both men deny the charges against them and the US government maintains that the allegations are baseless."
