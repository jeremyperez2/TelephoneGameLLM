Just as they are trying to censor this brilliant and refreshing documentary on Dr. Zucker, (I'd encourage you to look into this heroic professional who was black listed by these career, taxpayer bleeding, social justice warriors and militant activists), they did the same thing with the Ontario Sex Ed curriculum.  They banned any parental feedback and deferred to the activist themselves to review it and approve it, despite the fact that it heavily promotes gender diasphora, and the fantasies of Ben Levin.\n\nThese totalitarians operate under the guise of gaining equality for a supposed marginalized group, but are willing to go scorched earth with your children to get what they want.  If you don't go along you're branded a homophobe or ignorant, but ask them for any scientific evidence and they'll trot out some junk science and personally attack you.",

The most recent victim of these groups is a documentary about Dr. Zucker, who was attacked by social justice activists for his opinions on gender identity. This echoes the incident involving the Ontario Sex Ed curriculum, where parental input was disregarded and the curriculum was approved by the activists themselves. The curriculum promotes gender dysphoria and the fantasies of Ben Levin, who has been convicted of child pornography.\n\nThese totalitarians claim to be fighting for the rights of marginalized groups, but they are willing to sacrifice children's welfare for their own gain. If you don't agree with them, you will be labeled a homophobe or ignorant. Ask them for scientific evidence and they will provide you with junk science and personal attacks."
