            "Kathleen Wynne and her allies, who have no regard for moral principles, are trying to suppress a thought-provoking and enlightening documentary about Dr. Zucker, who has been added to a list of undesirables by self-centered, tax-hungry social justice warriors and radical activists. They are also attempting to do the same with the Ontario Sex Ed curriculum, which strongly promotes gender dysphoria and the delusions of Ben Levin, by prohibiting any input from parents and relying solely on the views of the activists themselves to examine and certify it.\n\nThese oppressors claim to be fighting for equality for a group they believe is being oppressed, but they are willing to put your children at risk to achieve their goals. If you refuse to comply, you will be called homophobic or ignorant, but if you ask them for any scientific proof, they will provide you with fake science and attack you personally."
