            "Musculoskeletal diseases and cognitive impairments can make it difficult to move around, which can have a negative impact on mental health. Clinical gait analysis is an important tool for diagnosing and treating these conditions early on, but it traditionally relies on expensive optical motion capture systems. However, recent advances in computer vision and deep learning have made it possible to create more affordable and accessible alternatives. In this paper, we present a new transformer network that can estimate critical gait parameters from RGB videos captured by a single-view camera. Our framework is able to surpass current state-of-the-art approaches and shows significant improvements in predicting general gait parameters (such as walking speed, Gait Deviation Index - GDI, and knee flexion angle at maximum extension), while utilizing fewer parameters and eliminating the need for manual feature extraction."
