The shortage and bad quality of available data have made automatic and specialized study frameworks hard to create, frequently relying on human input for labelling and verification. In this paper, we present a feature extraction framework for bias triangles based on unsupervised, segmentation-based computer vision methods. This approach lets us directly identify and measure physical properties of bias triangles, getting rid of the need for human input or big training datasets to tell supervised learning approaches what to do. We also show that Pauli spin blockade detection can be done well, quickly, and without any training data as a direct result of this approach."
