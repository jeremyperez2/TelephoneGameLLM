    "initial_story": "We perhaps should not be surprised that the prime minister has seized upon an extrapolation of Thursday's local election results that pointed to the prospect that the general election could result in a hung parliament in which Labour would be the largest party.\n\nSuch a scenario, he argued, would mean that Sir Keir Starmer would be \"propped up in Downing Street\" by the SNP, the Liberal Democrats, and the Greens.\n\nMany Conservative MPs (and indeed Labour ones too) believe that a poster their party ran in the 2015 election, when the polls were pointing to a hung parliament, showing the then Labour leader, Ed Miliband, in the pocket of the former SNP leader, Alex Salmond, played a key role in delivering the Conservatives a surprise overall majority.\n\nWhether or not that is what happened is not easy for analysts to say. However, British Election Study data collected at the time did not show any marked swing away from Labour among those who came to believe that Mr Miliband would be willing to do a deal with the SNP.\n\nBut, in any event, how realistic is it to use the share of the vote won by the parties in local elections to anticipate what might happen in an immediate general election? There are certainly two potential difficulties.\n\nAlthough the ups and downs in party performance in local elections often run in parallel with the rises and falls in party support in the polls, some people (around one in five) vote differently in local elections than they would in a general election.\n\nAs a result the divergence between the level of support parties win in a local election and how well they would perform in a general election has become more marked.\n\nNowadays the Liberal Democrats consistently outperform their national standing in the local ballot boxes. The same has also come to be true of the Greens, while independent candidates have also enjoyed some notable success in recent years. Labour, in contrast, often do less well in local elections.\n\nMeanwhile, the party political battle in Scotland is now very different from that in England - and the outcome of the current battle north of the border between Labour and the SNP could be crucial to the result of the next election. English local elections do not tell us much about what will happen north of the border.\n\nThese developments have made discerning the implications of local elections for the outcome of a general election more difficult.\n\nAt the same time, there are two particular features of the results of this year's local elections that make it especially difficult.\n\nFirst, the polls suggest that more people who voted Conservative in 2019 have now switched to Reform than to Labour. But Reform were only on the ballot paper in one in six council wards. So, it may well be the case that people who would vote Reform if there had been a Reform candidate locally stuck with the Tories instead.\n\nCertainly, Conservative support fell more heavily where Reform did stand. In the BBC's sample of key wards the party's support fell by 19 points in these wards - compared with 11 points in wards where Reform did not stand. Labour, in contrast, did rather better where Reform stood.\n\nThat 19-point drop matches the 19-point fall in the average level of Conservative support in the polls since May 2021. That figure may represent a better guide to the Conservatives' immediate prospects in a general election.\n\nSecond, the local election results confirm the message from last year's contests that the geography of party support has changed to the Conservatives' disadvantage.\n\nThe party's support fell more heavily in wards it was trying to defend.\n\nAt the same time, some voters seemingly voted for whichever party was best placed to defeat the Conservatives locally. Labour's support increased most (at the expense of the Liberal Democrats) in wards where they started off second to the Conservatives, while the Liberal Democrats advanced most (and Labour did less well) in wards where were the principal challengers locally.\n\nIndeed, it is these two patterns that help explain why the Conservative Party lost nearly one in two of the council seats it was trying to defend. Conservative MPs would be unwise to assume that the same fate could not also befall them.\n\nSir John Curtice is Professor of Politics, University of Strathclyde, and Senior Fellow, National Centre for Social Research and 'The UK in a Changing Europe'.

English local elections do not provide much insight into what will happen north of the border.\n\nThese developments have made it challenging to understand the implications of local elections for the outcome of a general election.\n\nThere are two particular features of this year's local election results that make it especially difficult.\n\nFirst, the polls suggest that more people who voted Conservative in 2019 have switched to Reform instead of Labour. However, Reform was only on the ballot paper in one in six council wards. Therefore, it is possible that people who would vote Reform if there was a Reform candidate locally ended up voting for the Tories instead.\n\nThe Conservative Party's support fell more heavily where Reform did stand, while Labour did better where Reform stood.\n\nThat 19-point decrease matches the 19-point drop in the average level of Conservative support in the polls since May 2021. That figure may be a better indicator of the Conservatives' immediate prospects in a general election.\n\nSecond, the local election results confirm the message from last year's contests that the geography of party support has changed to the Conservatives' disadvantage.\n\nThe party's support fell more heavily in wards they were defending.\n\nAt the same time, some voters seemingly voted for whichever party was best placed to defeat the Conservatives locally. Labour's support increased most in wards where they started off second to the Conservatives, while the Liberal Democrats advanced most in wards where they were the principal challengers locally.\n\nThese two patterns help explain why the Conservative Party lost nearly half of the council seats it was trying to defend.

            "Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said that the possibility of a hung parliament in the next general election, with the Labour Party as the largest party, cannot be ruled out. He made this statement in response to the results of Thursday's local elections, which showed a significant decline in support for the Conservatives.\n\nMr Sunak suggested that such a scenario would result in Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer being \"supported in Downing Street\" by the Scottish National Party (SNP), the Liberal Democrats, and the Greens. However, some Conservative MPs and Labour MPs have suggested that a poster run by the Conservatives in the 2015 election, which depicted the then Labour leader Ed Miliband in the pocket of the former SNP leader Alex Salmond, contributed to the Conservatives' surprise overall majority. This claim is disputed by data from the British Election Study, which showed no significant swing away from Labour among those who believed Mr Miliband would negotiate with the SNP.\n\nPredicting the outcome of an immediate general election based on the share of the vote won by the parties in local elections can be challenging due to two potential issues.\n\nFirstly, while changes in party performance in local elections often reflect changes in party support in the polls, some people (around one in five) vote differently in local elections compared to how they would vote in a general election.

            "In recent local elections in the UK, the Conservative Party lost nearly half of the council seats it was trying to defend.

This is because the party's 19-point decrease in the average level of support in the polls since May 2021 may be a better indicator of their chances. This is because people who would vote Reform if there was a Reform candidate locally may have voted for the Tories instead, as Reform was only on the ballot paper in one in six council wards.\n\nSome Conservative and Labour MPs have claimed that a poster run by the Conservatives in the 2015 election, which depicted the then Labour leader Ed Miliband in the pocket of the former SNP leader Alex Salmond, contributed to the Conservatives' surprise overall majority. However, data from the British Election Study does not support this claim, as it showed no significant swing away from Labour among those who believed Mr Miliband would negotiate with the SNP.\n\nPredicting the outcome of an immediate general election based on the share of the vote won by the parties in local elections is challenging due to two potential issues. Firstly, while changes in party performance in local elections often reflect changes in party support in the polls, some people vote differently in local elections compared to how they would vote in a general election. This has resulted in a growing gap between the level of support parties receive in a local election and how well they would perform in a general election. The Liberal Democrats have consistently outperformed their national standing in local ballot boxes, while independent candidates have also had some notable success in recent years. However, Labour often underperforms in local elections.

English local elections do not provide much insight into what will happen north of the border.\n\nThese developments have made it challenging to understand the implications of local elections for the outcome of a general election.\n\nThe results of the 2023 local elections are particularly difficult to interpret for two reasons. Firstly, the polls suggest that more people who voted Conservative in 2019 have switched to Reform instead of Labour. However, Reform was only on the ballot paper in one in six council wards.

Firstly, while changes in party performance in local elections often reflect changes in party support in the polls, some people vote differently in local elections compared to how they would vote in a general election. This has resulted in a growing gap between the level of support parties receive in a local election and how well they would perform in a general election. The Liberal Democrats have consistently outperformed their national standing in local ballot boxes, while independent candidates have also had some notable success in recent years. However, Labour often underperforms in local elections. Secondly, the party political battle in Scotland is very different from that in England, and the outcome of the current battle between Labour and the SNP could be crucial to the result of the next election. English local elections do not provide much insight into what will happen north of the border. These developments have made it challenging to understand the implications of local elections for the outcome of a general election. The results of the 2023 local elections are particularly difficult to interpret for two reasons. Firstly, the polls suggest that more people who voted Conservative in 2019 have switched to Reform instead of Labour. However, Reform was only on the ballot paper in one in six council wards. Therefore, it is possible that people who would vote Reform if there was a Reform candidate locally ended up voting for the Tories instead. The Conservative Party's support fell more heavily where Reform did stand, while Labour did better where Reform stood. The 19-point decrease in the average level of Conservative support in the polls since May 2021 may be a better indicator of the Conservatives' immediate prospects in a general election than the results of the local elections. Secondly, the local election results confirm the message from last year's contests that the geography of party support has changed to the Conservatives' disadvantage. The party's support fell more heavily in wards they were defending. At the same time, some voters seemingly voted for whichever party was best placed to defeat the Conservatives locally. Labour's support increased most in wards where they started off second to the Conservatives, while the Liberal Democrats advanced most in wards where they were the principal challengers locally. These two patterns help explain why the Conservative Party lost nearly half of the council seats it was trying to defend.

            "There are several reasons why the Conservative Party experienced significant losses in the recent local elections in the UK. One factor is changes in the geographical distribution of party support and tactical voting by some voters. The results suggest that the party's support declined more in wards it was defending, while some voters apparently voted for whichever party was best positioned to defeat the Conservatives locally. Labour's support increased most in wards where they were second to the Conservatives, while the Liberal Democrats advanced most in wards where they were the primary challengers.

Some voters who would have voted Reform if there was a Reform candidate locally may have voted for the Tories instead, as Reform was only on the ballot paper in one in six council wards. Some Conservative and Labour MPs have claimed that a poster run by the Conservatives in the 2015 election, which depicted the then Labour leader Ed Miliband in the pocket of the former SNP leader Alex Salmond, contributed to the Conservatives' surprise overall majority.

Some voters who would have voted for the Reform Party if it had been on the ballot may have voted for the Conservatives instead, as the Reform Party was only on the ballot in one in six council wards. Some Conservative and Labour MPs have claimed that a poster run by the Conservatives in the 2015 election, which depicted the then Labour leader Ed Miliband in the pocket of the former SNP leader Alex Salmond, contributed to the Conservatives' surprise overall majority. However, data from the British Election Study does not support this claim, as it showed no significant swing away from Labour among those who believed Mr Miliband would negotiate with the SNP. Predicting the outcome of an immediate general election based on the share of the vote won by the parties in local elections is challenging due to two potential issues. Firstly, while changes in party performance in local elections often reflect changes in party support in the polls, some people vote differently in local elections compared to how they would vote in a general election. This has resulted in a growing gap between the level of support parties receive in a local election and how well they would perform in a general election. The Liberal Democrats have consistently outperformed their national standing in local ballot boxes, while independent candidates have also had some notable success in recent years. However, Labour often underperforms in local elections. Secondly, the party political battle in Scotland is very different from that in England, and the outcome of the current battle between Labour and the SNP could be crucial to the result of the next election. English local elections do not provide much insight into what will happen north of the border. These developments have made it challenging to understand the implications of local elections for the outcome of a general election. The results of the 2023 local elections are particularly difficult to interpret for two reasons. Firstly, the polls suggest that more people who voted Conservative in 2019 have switched to Reform instead of Labour. However, Reform was only on the ballot paper in one in six council wards. Therefore, it is possible that people who would vote Reform if there was a Reform candidate locally ended up voting for the Tories instead. The Conservative Party's support fell more heavily where Reform did stand, while Labour did better where Reform stood. The 19-point decrease in the average level of Conservative support in the polls since May 2021 may be a better indicator of the Conservatives' immediate prospects in a general election than the results of the local elections. Secondly, the local election results confirm the message from last year's contests that the geography of party support has changed to the Conservatives' disadvantage. The party's support fell more heavily in areas where it was defending. At the same time, some voters seemingly voted for whichever party was best placed to defeat the Conservatives locally. Labour's support increased most in areas where they started off second to the Conservatives, while the Liberal Democrats advanced most in areas where they were the principal challengers locally. These two patterns help explain why the Conservative Party lost nearly half of the council seats it was trying to defend. Conservative MPs would be unwise to assume that the same fate could not also befall them.

            "In recent local elections in the United Kingdom, the Conservative Party experienced a decline in support due to changing voter preferences and strategic voting. An analysis of the data revealed that the party lost more support in areas where it was defending seats, while some voters appeared to have voted for the party best positioned to defeat the Conservatives locally. While Labour's support increased most in areas where they were second to the Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats made the most gains in areas where they were the primary challengers. However, the results of the local elections may not be the best indicator of the Conservatives' immediate prospects in a general election. This is because the party's 19-point decrease in the average level of support in the polls since May 2021 may be a more accurate predictor of their chances. Some voters who would have voted for the Reform Party if it had been on the ballot may have voted for the Conservatives instead, as the Reform Party was only on the ballot in one in six council wards. Some Conservative and Labour MPs have claimed that a poster run by the Conservatives in the 2015 election, which depicted the then Labour leader Ed Miliband in the pocket of the former SNP leader Alex Salmond, contributed to the Conservatives' surprise overall majority. However, data from the British Election Study does not support this claim, as it showed no significant swing away from Labour among those who believed Mr Miliband would negotiate with the SNP. Predicting the outcome of an immediate general election based on the share of the vote won by the parties in local elections is challenging due to two potential issues. Firstly, while changes in party performance in local elections often reflect changes in party support in the polls, some people vote differently in local elections compared to how they would vote in a general election. This has resulted in a growing gap between the level of support parties receive in a local election and how well they would perform in a general election. The Liberal Democrats have consistently outperformed their national standing in local ballot boxes, while independent candidates have also had some notable success in recent years. However, Labour often underperforms in local elections. Secondly, the party political battle in Scotland is very different from that in England, and the outcome of the current battle between Labour and the SNP could be crucial to the result of the next election. English local elections do not provide much insight into what will happen north of the border. These developments have made it difficult to understand the implications of local elections for the outcome of a general election. The results of the 2023 local elections are particularly difficult to interpret for two reasons. Firstly, the polls suggest that more people who voted Conservative in 2019 have switched to Reform instead of Labour. However, Reform was only on the ballot paper in one in six council wards. Therefore, it is possible that people who would vote Reform if there was a Reform candidate locally ended up voting for the Tories instead. The Conservative Party's support fell more heavily where Reform did stand, while Labour did better where Reform stood. The 19-point decrease in the average level of Conservative support in the polls since May 2021 may be a better indicator of the Conservatives' immediate prospects in a general election than the results of the local elections. Secondly, the local election results confirm the message from last year's contests that the geography of party support has changed to the Conservatives' disadvantage. The party's support fell more heavily in areas where it was defending. At the same time, some voters seemingly voted for whichever party was best placed to defeat the Conservatives locally. Labour's support increased most in areas where they started off second to the Conservatives, while the Liberal Democrats advanced most in areas where they were the principal challengers locally. These two patterns help explain why the Conservative Party lost nearly half of the council seats it was trying to defend. Conservative MPs would be unwise to assume that the same fate could not also befall them.

            "The Conservative Party suffered significant losses in the recent UK local elections due to changing voter preferences and strategic voting, as revealed by an analysis of the data. The party lost more seats in areas where it was defending, while some voters appeared to have voted for the party best positioned to defeat the Conservatives locally. Labour's support increased most in areas where they were second to the Conservatives, while the Liberal Democrats made the most gains in areas where they were the primary challengers. However, the local election results may not be the best indicator of the Conservatives' immediate prospects in a general election. This is because the party's 19-point decrease in the average level of support in the polls since May 2021 may be a more accurate predictor of their chances. Some voters who would have voted for the Reform Party if it had been on the ballot may have voted for the Conservatives instead, as the Reform Party was only on the ballot in one in six council wards. Some Conservative and Labour MPs have claimed that a poster run by the Conservatives in the 2015 election, which depicted the then Labour leader Ed Miliband in the pocket of the former SNP leader Alex Salmond, contributed to the Conservatives' surprise overall majority. However, data from the British Election Study does not support this claim, as it showed no significant swing away from Labour among those who believed Mr Miliband would negotiate with the SNP. Predicting the outcome of an immediate general election based on the share of the vote won by the parties in local elections is challenging due to two potential issues. Firstly, while changes in party performance in local elections often reflect changes in party support in the polls, some people vote differently in local elections compared to how they would vote in a general election. This has resulted in a growing gap between the level of support parties receive in a local election and how well they would perform in a general election. The Liberal Democrats have consistently outperformed their national standing in local ballot boxes, while independent candidates have also had some notable success in recent years. However, Labour often underperforms in local elections. Secondly, the party political battle in Scotland is very different from that in England, and the outcome of the current battle between Labour and the SNP could be crucial to the result of the next election. English local elections do not provide much insight into what will happen north of the border. These developments have made it difficult to understand the implications of local elections for the outcome of a general election. The results of the 2023 local elections are particularly difficult to interpret for two reasons. Firstly, the polls suggest that more people who voted Conservative in 2019 have switched to Reform instead of Labour. However, Reform was only on the ballot paper in one in six council wards. Therefore, it is possible that people who would vote Reform if there was a Reform candidate locally ended up voting for the Tories instead. The Conservative Party's support fell more heavily where Reform did stand, while Labour did better where Reform stood. The 19-point decrease in the average level of Conservative support in the polls since May 2021 may be a better indicator of the Conservatives' immediate prospects in a general election than the results of the local elections.
