However, British Election Study data collected at the time did not show any marked swing away from Labour among those who came to believe that Mr Miliband would be willing to do a deal with the SNP.\n\nBut, in any event, how realistic is it to use the share of the vote won by the parties in local elections to anticipate what might happen in an immediate general election? There are certainly two potential difficulties.\n\nAlthough the ups and downs in party performance in local elections often run in parallel with the rises and falls in party support in the polls, some people (around one in five) vote differently in local elections than they would in a general election.\n\nAs a result the divergence between the level of support parties win in a local election and how well they would perform in a general election has become more marked.\n\nNowadays the Liberal Democrats consistently outperform their national standing in the local ballot boxes. The same has also come to be true of the Greens, while independent candidates have also enjoyed some notable success in recent years. Labour, in contrast, often do less well in local elections.\n\nMeanwhile, the party political battle in Scotland is now very different from that in England - and the outcome of the current battle north of the border between Labour and the SNP could be crucial to the result of the next election. English local elections do not tell us much about what will happen north of the border.\n\nThese developments have made discerning the implications of local elections for the outcome of a general election more difficult.\n\nAt the same time, there are two particular features of the results of this year's local elections that make it especially difficult.\n\nFirst, the polls suggest that more people who voted Conservative in 2019 have now switched to Reform than to Labour. But Reform were only on the ballot paper in one in six council wards. So, it may well be the case that people who would vote Reform if there had been a Reform candidate locally stuck with the Tories instead.\n\nCertainly, Conservative support fell more heavily where Reform did stand. In the BBC's sample of key wards the party's support fell by 19 points in these wards - compared with 11 points in wards where Reform did not stand. Labour, in contrast, did rather better where Reform stood.\n\nThat 19-point drop matches the 19-point fall in the average level of Conservative support in the polls since May 2021. That figure may represent a better guide to the Conservatives' immediate prospects in a general election.\n\nSecond, the local election results confirm the message from last year's contests that the geography of party support has changed to the Conservatives' disadvantage.\n\nThe party's support fell more heavily in wards it was trying to defend.\n\nAt the same time, some voters seemingly voted for whichever party was best placed to defeat the Conservatives locally. Labour's support increased most (at the expense of the Liberal Democrats) in wards where they started off second to the Conservatives, while the Liberal Democrats advanced most (and Labour did less well) in wards where were the principal challengers locally.\n\nIndeed, it is these two patterns that help explain why the Conservative Party lost nearly one in two of the council seats it was trying to defend. Conservative MPs would be unwise to assume that the same fate could not also befall them.\n\nSir John Curtice is Professor of Politics, University of Strathclyde, and Senior Fellow, National Centre for Social Research and 'The UK in a Changing Europe'.

There are two potential difficulties.\n\nAlthough the ups and downs in party performance in local elections often run in parallel with the rises and falls in party support in the polls, some people (around one in five) vote differently in local elections than they would in a general election.\n\nAs a result, the divergence between the level of support parties win in a local election and how well they would perform in a general election has become more marked.\n\nNowadays the Liberal Democrats consistently outperform their national standing in the local ballot boxes. The same has also come to be true of the Greens, while independent candidates have also enjoyed some notable success in recent years. Labour, in contrast, often do less well in local elections.\n\nMeanwhile, the party political battle in Scotland is now very different from that in England - and the outcome of the current battle north of the border between Labour and the SNP could be crucial to the result of the next election. English local elections do not tell us much about what will happen north of the border.\n\nThese developments have made discerning the implications of local elections for the outcome of a general election more difficult.\n\nAt the same time, there are two particular features of the results of this year's local elections that make it especially difficult.\n\nFirst, the polls suggest that more people who voted Conservative in 2019 have now switched to Reform than to Labour. But Reform were only on the ballot paper in one in six council wards. So, it may well be the case that people who would vote Reform if there had been a Reform candidate locally stuck with the Tories instead.\n\nCertainly, Conservative support fell more heavily where Reform did stand. In the BBC's sample of key wards the party's support fell by 19 points in these wards - compared with 11 points in wards where Reform did not stand. Labour, in contrast, did rather better where Reform stood.\n\nThat 19-point drop matches the 19-point fall in the average level of Conservative support in the polls since May 2021. That figure may represent a better guide to the Conservatives' immediate prospects in a general election.\n\nSecond, the local election results confirm the message from last year's contests that the geography of party support has changed to the Conservatives' disadvantage.\n\nThe party's support fell more heavily in wards it was trying to defend.\n\nAt the same time, some voters seemingly voted for whichever party was best placed to defeat the Conservatives locally. Labour's support increased most (at the expense of the Liberal Democrats) in wards where they started off second to the Conservatives, while the Liberal Democrats advanced most (and Labour did less well) in wards where were the principal challengers locally.\n\nIndeed, it is these two patterns that help explain why the Conservative Party lost nearly one in two of the council seats it was trying to defend. Conservative MPs would be unwise to assume that the same fate could not also befall them.\n\nSir John Curtice is Professor of Politics, University of Strathclyde, and Senior Fellow, National Centre for Social Research and 'The UK in a Changing Europe'.

            "If the general election were to result in a hung parliament as a result of the local elections that were held on Thursday, Liz Truss, the Prime Minister, has stated that Sir Keir Starmer would be \"supported in Downing Street\" by the SNP, the Liberal Democrats, and the Greens. This is the case if Labour were to be the largest party based on an extrapolation of the results of the local elections that were held on Thursday.\n\nAlthough analysts are unable to determine whether or not this happened, data from the British Election Study gathered at the time did not indicate any significant shift away from Labour among those who came to believe that Mr. Miliband would be open to a deal with the SNP.\n\nIt is challenging to use the parties' share of the vote in local elections to predict what would happen in a general election that was held right away. There are two potential issues.\n\nAround one in five people vote differently in local elections than they would in a general election, despite the fact that the ups and downs in party performance in local elections frequently run in tandem with the polls' gains and losses in party support.\n\nNowadays, the Liberal Democrats consistently outperform their national standing in the local ballot boxes. The same has also come to be true of the Greens, while independent candidates have also enjoyed some notable success in recent years. In contrast, Labour frequently performs less well in local elections.\n\nMeanwhile, the party political struggle in Scotland is now very different from that in England, and the outcome of the current battle north of the border between Labour and the SNP could be crucial to the outcome of the next election. What will happen north of the border is not well predicted by English local elections.\n\nThese developments have made it more difficult to understand the implications of local elections for the result of a general election.\n\nAt the same time, two particular aspects of this year's local election results make it particularly challenging.\n\nFirst, the polls indicate that more people who voted Conservative in 2019 have now changed to Reform than to Labour. But Reform was only on the ballot in one out of every six council wards. As a result, it may be the case that people who would have voted for Reform if there had been a Reform candidate locally instead supported the Tories.\n\nIndeed, Conservative support dropped more significantly in wards where Reform did stand. In the BBC's sample of important wards, the party's support dropped by 19 points in those wards, compared to 11 points in wards where Reform did not stand.

This conclusion is based on an extrapolation of Thursday's local election results if Labour were to be the largest party.\n\nAccording to an analysis by the British Election Study, there was no significant shift away from Labour among those who believed that Mr. Miliband would be open to a deal with the SNP, despite the fact that the results of the local elections held on Thursday cannot be used to determine whether or not this happened.\n\nThere are two potential issues with using the parties' share of the vote in local elections to predict what would happen in a general election held immediately. There are two potential issues.\n\nOne in five people vote differently in local elections than they would in a general election, despite the fact that the ups and downs in party performance in local elections frequently run in tandem with the polls' gains and losses in party support.\n\nNowadays, the Liberal Democrats consistently outperform their national standing in the local ballot boxes. The same has also become true of the Greens, while independent candidates have also enjoyed some notable success in recent years. In contrast, Labour frequently performs less well in local elections.\n\nMeanwhile, the party political battle in Scotland is now very different from that in England, and the outcome of the current battle north of the border between Labour and the SNP could be crucial to the outcome of the next election. What will happen north of the border is not well predicted by English local elections.\n\nThese developments have made it more difficult to understand the implications of local elections for the outcome of a general election.\n\nAt the same time, two particular aspects of this year's local election results make it particularly challenging.\n\nFirst, the polls suggest that more people who voted Conservative in 2019 have now switched to Reform than to Labour. However, Reform was only on the ballot in one in six council wards. As a result, it may be the case that people who would have voted for Reform if there had been a Reform candidate locally instead supported the Tories.\n\nIndeed, Conservative support decreased more significantly in wards where Reform did stand. In the BBC's sample of key wards, the party's support decreased by 19 points in those wards, compared to 11 points in wards where Reform did not stand. In contrast, Labour performed better where Reform stood.\n\nThat 19-point decrease matches the 19-point drop in the Conservatives' average level of support in the polls since May 2021. That number may provide a better indication of the Conservatives' immediate prospects in a general election.\n\nSecond, the local election results confirm last year's contests' message that the geography of party support has changed to the Conservatives' disadvantage.\n\nIn wards that the party was defending, its support decreased more drastically.\n\nAt the same time, some voters appeared to vote for whichever party was best positioned to beat the Conservatives locally. In wards where they started off in second place to the Conservatives, Labour's support increased the most (at the expense of the Liberal Democrats), while the Liberal Democrats advanced the most (and Labour did less well) in wards where they were the main challengers locally.\n\nIn fact, it is these two patterns that help explain why the Conservative Party lost almost one in two council seats it was attempting to defend. Conservative MPs should not assume that their fate could not be the same.\n\nProfessor of Politics at the University of Strathclyde, Senior Fellow at the National Centre for Social Research, and The UK in a Changing Europe, Sir John Curtice.

As a result, it may be the case that people who would have voted for Reform if there had been a Reform candidate locally instead supported the Tories.\n\nIndeed, Conservative support decreased more significantly in wards where Reform did stand.

            "A hung parliament is a possibility in the upcoming election, and Liz Truss asserts that Keir Starmer would be supported by the SNP, Liberal Democrats, and Greens in Downing Street if this occurred. This claim is based on the projection of what would happen if Labour was the largest party in the local elections on Thursday and these results were projected onto the general election.\n\nThe results of the local elections on Thursday cannot be used to determine whether or not this was the case, even though the British Election Study found that there was no significant shift away from Labour among those who believed that Miliband would be open to a deal with the SNP.\n\nThere are two potential issues with using the parties' share of the vote in local elections to predict what would happen in a general election held immediately. There are two potential issues.\n\nOne in five people vote differently in local elections than they would in a general election, even though the ups and downs in party performance in local elections often run in tandem with the polls' gains and losses in party support.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats consistently outperform their national standing in the local ballot boxes. The same has also become true of the Greens, while independent candidates have also enjoyed some notable success in recent years. In contrast, Labour frequently performs less well in local elections.\n\nMeanwhile, the party political battle in Scotland is now very different from that in England, and the outcome of the current battle north of the border between Labour and the SNP could be crucial to the outcome of the next election. What will happen north of the border is not well predicted by English local elections.\n\nThese developments have made it more difficult to understand the implications of local elections for the outcome of a general election.\n\nAt the same time, two specific aspects of this year's local election results make it particularly challenging.\n\nFirst, the polls suggest that more people who voted Conservative in 2019 have now switched to Reform than to Labour. However, Reform was only on the ballot in one in six council wards. As a result, it may be the case that people who would have voted for Reform if there had been a Reform candidate locally instead supported the Tories.\n\nIndeed, Conservative support decreased more significantly in wards where Reform did stand. In the BBC's sample of key wards, the party's support decreased by 19 points in those wards, compared to 11 points in wards where Reform did not stand. In contrast, Labour performed better where Reform stood.\n\nThat 19-point decrease matches the 19-point drop in the Conservatives' average level of support in the polls since May 2021. That number may provide a better indication of the Conservatives' immediate prospects in a general election.\n\nSecond, the local election results confirm last year's contests' message that the geography of party support has changed to the Conservatives' disadvantage.\n\nIn wards that the party was defending, its support decreased more drastically.\n\nAt the same time, some voters appeared to vote for whichever party was best positioned to beat the Conservatives locally. In wards where they started off in second place to the Conservatives, Labour's support increased the most (at the expense of the Liberal Democrats), while the Liberal Democrats advanced the most (and Labour did less well) in wards where they were the main challengers locally.\n\nIn fact, it is these two patterns that help explain why the Conservative Party lost almost one in two council seats it was attempting to defend.

            "The use of local election results to predict the outcome of a general election held at the same time is subject to two significant limitations.\n\nOne limitation is that only around 20% of voters change their vote between local elections and general elections. This means that there is not much room for predicting how people will vote based on their voting behaviour in local elections.\n\nAnother limitation is that the Liberal Democrats tend to do better in local elections than in national polls. This is also true for the Greens and independent candidates, who have had some success in recent years. Labour, on the other hand, often performs worse in local elections.\n\nAt the same time, the battle between Labour and the SNP in Scotland is now very different from the party political battle in England. The outcome of the current battle north of the border between Labour and the SNP could be crucial to the outcome of the next election. However, it is not well predicted by English local elections. This is because the two elections are held at different times and the issues that are important to voters can be different.\n\nThese developments have made it more difficult to understand the implications of local elections for the outcome of a general election.\n\nMeanwhile, two specific aspects of this year's local election results make it particularly challenging.\n\nOne aspect is that the polls suggest that more people who voted Conservative in 2019 have now switched to Reform than to Labour. However, Reform was only on the ballot in one in six council wards. This means that there is a possibility that people who would have voted for Reform if there had been a Reform candidate locally instead supported the Tories.\n\nIndeed, Conservative support decreased more significantly in wards where Reform did stand. In the BBC's sample of key wards, the party's support decreased by 19 points in those wards, compared to 11 points in wards where Reform did not stand. In contrast, Labour performed better where Reform stood.\n\nThat 19-point decrease matches the 19-point drop in the Conservatives' average level of support in the polls since May 2021. This number may provide a better indication of the Conservatives' immediate prospects in a general election.\n\nAnother aspect is that the local election results confirm last year's contests' message that the geography of party support has changed to the Conservatives' disadvantage.\n\nIn wards that the party was defending, its support decreased more drastically. At the same time, some voters appeared to vote for whichever party was best positioned to beat the Conservatives locally.
