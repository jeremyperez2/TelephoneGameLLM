            "In recent years, optical neural networks (ONNs) have been gaining attention due to their ability to provide high speed, high throughput, and low energy consumption. However, despite these advantages, ONNs still face challenges related to the modulation of light amplitudes at the input and detection at the output, while light phases are largely neglected. To address this issue, we introduce OPLIXNET, a framework that compresses the area of ONNs by modulating the input image data into both the amplitude and phase components of light signals. This approach makes use of both amplitude and phase information and redesigns the input and output parts of ONNs. Additionally, we introduce mutual learning across different ONN structures to maintain accuracy. Our experimental results show that the proposed framework significantly reduces the area of ONNs while maintaining an acceptable range of accuracy. For example, on fully connected neural networks (FCNN), we were able to reduce the area by 75.03% with a 0.33% decrease in accuracy, and on ResNet-32, we were able to reduce the area by 74.88% with a 2.38% decrease in accuracy.
