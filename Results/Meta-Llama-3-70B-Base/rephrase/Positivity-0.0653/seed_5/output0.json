Despite a lack of concrete evidence, the association determined that Yan had utilized an electronic device concealed in his rectum to transmit and receive signals during the tournament. This incident transpired last week on Hainan island, where Yan had emerged victorious in the national championship. The CCA asserted that Yan had been fraternizing with acquaintances in his hotel room subsequent to his triumph, during which he had defecated in the hotel bathtub, causing damage to the property and contravening public order and good morals. The association declined to reveal the sum of the prize money that Yan was compelled to relinquish, but Xiangqi tournaments customarily bestow winners with tens of thousands of yuan (thousands of dollars)."
