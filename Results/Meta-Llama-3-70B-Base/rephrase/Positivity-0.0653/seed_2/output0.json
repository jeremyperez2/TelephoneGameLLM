            "A Xiangqi player has been banned from competition and had their title revoked after they were accused of cheating and causing a disturbance during a match. It is alleged that the player used wireless devices hidden in their anal beads to communicate with someone outside of the game, giving them an unfair advantage over their opponents. In addition to the cheating allegations, the player also caused a disturbance by consuming a large amount of alcohol and defecating in the bathtub of their hotel room, causing damage to the property and violating public order and good morals. The amount of prize money that the player forfeited has not been disclosed by the tournament organizers, but professional Xiangqi tournaments typically offer winners tens of thousands of yuan, which is equivalent to thousands of dollars."
