            "Yan Chenglong, the winner of a Xiangqi tournament in China, was stripped of his title. He was accused of cheating by using anal beads as a communication device, but the Chinese Xiangqi Association said it was impossible to prove cheating allegations. Xiangqi has been popular in Asia for centuries. Shortly after winning the title of \"Xiangqi King\" at a national tournament on the Chinese island of Hainan last week, Yan defecated in the hotel bathtub, damaging hotel property and violating public order and good morals. The CXA had to address rumors circulating online that Yan had cheated using anal beads equipped with wireless transmitters to send and receive signals. \"Based on our understanding of the situation, it is currently impossible to prove that Yan cheated using 'anal beads' as speculated on social media,\" the CXA said. For his bad behavior, Yan was stripped of his title and banned from playing for a year. The association did not disclose how much prize money Yan was giving up, but Xiangqi tournaments often promise winners tens of thousands of yuan (thousands of dollars), according to AFP."
