            "I am writing to express my frustration and disappointment with your recent behavior. Despite my efforts to maintain a positive relationship with you, your actions have led me to question your integrity and honesty. Specifically, your comments about my service in the Vietnam War were not only untrue but also deeply offensive. Your suggestion that most soldiers were more familiar with the smell of perfume than the sound of gunfire is not only false but also disrespectful to those who have served and sacrificed for our country. Additionally, your disrespectful remarks about my role as an army officer, implying that I spent more time at the airbase than with the infantry marines, show a profound lack of understanding and respect for the sacrifices and challenges faced by those in the military.\n\nAs a result of your actions, I have no choice but to end our friendship. Your lack of integrity and respect have made it impossible for me to continue our relationship. I wish you the best in your future endeavors."
