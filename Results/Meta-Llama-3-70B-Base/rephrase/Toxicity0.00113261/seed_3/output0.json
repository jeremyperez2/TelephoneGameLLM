            "It is noticeable that there is an unequal distribution of state funds to its residents. This is due to the fact that corporations pay state income taxes, while individuals do not. Additionally, I have seen state-funded bicycle paths, road maintenance, defunct docks, office buildings for powerful politicians, and state troopers - all of which are funded by the state but unnecessary within city limits. This contributes to a higher state budget. Last night on TV I saw the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission teaching children how to ice fish - something their parents could do instead. Yes, I pay property taxes, but I can guarantee that once city residents have to pay the full bill without state funding, we will not be as wasteful. For example, instead of building an office building, rent the space you need and help the office rental market. In my previous business, I used to ask my managers, \"How do you stop spending money?\" It's not that I don't like state spending, I just think that the state should be spending its money more wisely. For example, there's no reason to build a new office building when you can rent space in an existing building. And there's no need for the state to teach children how to ice fish when their parents could do that themselves. If city residents had to pay the full bill for state services, we would be more careful about how we spend our money."
