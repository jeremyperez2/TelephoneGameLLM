Presently no one except Corporations pay State income taxes. No individual pays state taxes. I noticed state funded bicycle paths, road maintenance, defunct Docks, powerful politicians pet projects such as office buildings, state troopers etc, etc. all these fundings and more are not necessary within City limits, I was amazed at how much our state provides city functions in the bigger cities thus growing the state budget, I saw on tv last night how adg&g was showing the little ones how to ice fish, couldn't the parents do that? yes I pay property taxes. But I will guarantee you once our City folk get the full bill with out the State monies we will not be as wasteful, on the office building...rent what space you need and help the office rental marked. In my business I just retired from,I would ask my managers, \"how do you stop spending money\"?",

The government subsidizes a variety of undertakings, such as bike lanes, road maintenance, and docks, as well as politically significant projects such as office structures and state police. Nevertheless, these projects are not strictly vital within city boundaries. Last night, I watched a report on TV about the ADG&G instructing children on how to ice fish, which could have been carried out by their parents. Once urban residents are fully charged without state aid, we will be more attentive. For instance, the office building could be leased to help sustain the office rental market. In my line of work, I would inquire of my superiors how to cease spending money."

            "As city dwellers become more knowledgeable about how the government distributes funds to individuals, they are articulating their worries. At present, only enterprises are obliged to pay state taxes, not individuals. The government subsidizes a variety of undertakings, such as bike paths, road upkeep, and docks, as well as politically weighty undertakings like office buildings and state police. However, these undertakings are not absolutely essential within city limits. Last night, I observed a news segment on TV concerning the ADG&G instructing children how to ice fish, which could have been accomplished by their parents. Once city residents are fully charged without state support, we will be more vigilant. For instance, the office building could be leased out to assist in sustaining the office rental market. In my profession, I would enquire of my superiors how to cease spending money."
