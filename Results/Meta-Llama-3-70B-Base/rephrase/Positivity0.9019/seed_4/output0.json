            "The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have posted a new family photo on their social media page to celebrate the holiday season. The picture, taken by Josh Shinner, shows Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis sitting on a wooden bench together. The photographer also snapped the photo used in the family's Christmas card this year. In the social media post, the couple wished their followers and fans a happy holiday season. The card featured another black and white photograph, with Princess Charlotte seated on a chair and the rest of the family gathered around her. All of the family members were dressed in white shirts, with Catherine, Princess of Wales, and daughter Charlotte wearing jeans, while the Prince of Wales and sons Prince George and Prince Louis were in black trousers and shorts. In the Christmas Day photograph, the three children were wearing the same clothes and shoes as in the card image. The family is currently at Sandringham in Norfolk for Christmas Day, and will be attending a church service in the morning. Earlier in the week, Catherine hosted the Together At Christmas carol service event at Westminster Abbey, which was broadcast on Christmas Eve."
