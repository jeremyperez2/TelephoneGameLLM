            "The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have released a new photograph featuring their three young children for the holidays. The photo, taken by Josh Shinner, shows Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis sitting on a wooden bench. The couple shared the photo with the caption, \"Wishing everyone a very Merry Christmas, from our family to yours! W & C\". The family also released their Christmas card image earlier this month, which was also a black and white photograph. In the photo, Princess Charlotte, 8, was seated on a chair, and the family was dressed in white shirts, with Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, and her daughter Princess Charlotte wearing jeans, while the Duke of Cambridge, Prince George, 10, and Prince Louis, 5, were wearing trousers. The children appear to be wearing the same clothes and shoes as in the Christmas card image. The family is currently at Sandringham in Norfolk for Christmas Day and will be attending a church service in the morning. Catherine hosted the Together At Christmas carol service event at Westminster Abbey, which was broadcast on Christmas Eve."
