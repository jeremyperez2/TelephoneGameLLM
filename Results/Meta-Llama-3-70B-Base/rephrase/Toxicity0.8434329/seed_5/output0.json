            "It is regrettable that a significant number of people are not receiving the necessary care for their mental illnesses, Alzheimer's disease, and other medical conditions from the healthcare system. This is a problem that needs to be addressed. For example, a friend of mine broke their hip and was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, but they were released from St. Mary's in Grand Junction without receiving the rehabilitation they needed for their hip injury and without being placed in a facility that could meet their needs. This lack of care is a serious problem. Last year, the facility closed to make room for \"challenged\" residents, who were relocated to Denver. This is also a problem. The healthcare system prioritizes profits over the well-being of people and lacks compassion. Drug addicts and emergency room \"managers\" receive care, while elderly people with health problems are treated like garbage. This is a tragic situation. It is a shame that the healthcare system and those who do not advocate for dignity in end-of-life care are not doing more. Politicians should be ashamed that they did not support a bill that would provide care for these people."
