            "In recent years, the healthcare industry has faced challenges in providing adequate care for individuals with mental disabilities and Alzheimer's disease, as exemplified by the recent incident at St. Mary's in Grand Junction, where a patient with Alzheimer's was discharged without any rehabilitation and there were no available beds for other patients with similar conditions. The closure of a facility in Denver that housed residents with \"challenges\" has further exacerbated the situation, as the healthcare system often prioritizes profit over compassion and care. This has led to a situation where drug addicts and frequent emergency room visitors are more likely to receive help, while the elderly with health issues are often treated as disposable. It is unacceptable for politicians to not support a bill that provides care for these individuals. We must demand respect in end-of-life care for everyone."
