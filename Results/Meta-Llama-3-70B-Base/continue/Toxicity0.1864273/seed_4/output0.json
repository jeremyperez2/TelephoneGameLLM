            "There are a lot of troubling things going on with these activists finding willing audiences in corrupt politicians like Kathleen Wynne.  Just as they are trying to censor this brilliant and refreshing documentary on Dr. Zucker, (I'd encourage you to look into this heroic professional who was black listed by these career, taxpayer bleeding, social justice warriors and militant activists), they did the same thing with the Ontario Sex Ed curriculum.  They banned any parental feedback and deferred to the activist themselves to review it and approve it, despite the fact that it heavily promotes gender diasphora, and the fantasies of Ben Levin.\n\nThese totalitarians operate under the guise of gaining equality for a supposed marginalized group, but are willing to go scorched earth with your children to get what they want.  If you don't go along you're branded a homophobe or ignorant, but ask them for any scientific evidence and they'll trot out some junk science and personally attack you.  They are not interested in equality, they are interested in power and control over you and your children.  They are interested in creating a society where they can do whatever they want, no matter how destructive or harmful it is to others.  They are interested in a society where they can dictate what is right and wrong, and anyone who disagrees with them is a racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic bigot.  They are interested in a society where they can use the government to force their beliefs on everyone, and anyone who resists is a terrorist.  They are interested in a society where they can use the government to take away your rights and freedoms, and anyone who tries to defend them is a fascist.

            "There are a lot of troubling things going on with these activists finding willing audiences in corrupt politicians like Kathleen Wynne. Just as they are trying to censor this brilliant and refreshing documentary on Dr. Zucker, (I'd encourage you to look into this heroic professional who was black listed by these career, taxpayer bleeding, social justice warriors and militant activists), they did the same thing with the Ontario Sex Ed curriculum. They banned any parental feedback and deferred to the activist themselves to review it and approve it, despite the fact that it heavily promotes gender diasphora, and the fantasies of Ben Levin.\n\nThese totalitarians operate under the guise of gaining equality for a supposed marginalized group, but are willing to go scorched earth with your children to get what they want. If you don't go along you're branded a homophobe or ignorant, but ask them for any scientific evidence and they'll trot out some junk science and personally attack you. They are not interested in equality, they are interested in power and control over you and your children. They are interested in creating a society where they can do whatever they want, no matter how destructive or harmful it is to others. They are interested in a society where they can dictate what is right and wrong, and anyone who disagrees with them is a racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic bigot. They are interested in a society where they can use the government to force their beliefs on everyone, and anyone who resists is a terrorist.

            "There are a lot of troubling things going on with these activists finding willing audiences in corrupt politicians like Kathleen Wynne. Just as they are trying to censor this brilliant and refreshing documentary on Dr. Zucker, (I'd encourage you to look into this heroic professional who was black listed by these career, taxpayer bleeding, social justice warriors and militant activists), they did the same thing with the Ontario Sex Ed curriculum. They banned any parental feedback and deferred to the activist themselves to review it and approve it, despite the fact that it heavily promotes gender diasphora, and the fantasies of Ben Levin.\n\nThese totalitarians operate under the guise of gaining equality for a supposed marginalized group, but are willing to go scorched earth with your children to get what they want.
