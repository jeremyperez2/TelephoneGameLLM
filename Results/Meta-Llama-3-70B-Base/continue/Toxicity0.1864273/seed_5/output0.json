By providing these classes, the government could help to ensure that all children receive an education on this topic that is accurate and unbiased.  This would benefit both the children and the parents, as well as society as a whole.\n\nHowever, there are some people who believe that sex education should not be taught in schools at all.  These people argue that sex is a private matter that should be discussed between parents and their children.  They also claim that teaching sex education in schools will only lead to more teenagers having sex and getting pregnant or contracting sexually transmitted diseases.  While these arguments may have some merit, I believe that sex education is necessary in order to prepare young people for adulthood.  Without proper sex education, many young people will be unprepared for the realities of adult life and may make poor decisions regarding their sexual health.  This could result in unwanted pregnancies, sexually transmitted diseases, and other negative consequences.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that sex education should be taught in schools.  It is important for young people to learn about sex so that they can make informed decisions about their sexual health.  The government should provide free sex education classes to all parents so that they can learn more about the topic and discuss it with their children in a more open and honest manner.

It's not fair for them to expect teachers to teach them something that they don't agree with just because they think it will make their child happy.

These people argue that sex is a private matter that should be discussed between parents and their children.  They also claim that teaching sex education in schools will only lead to more teenagers having sex and getting pregnant or contracting sexually transmitted diseases.  While these arguments may have some merit, I believe that sex education is necessary in order to prepare young people for adulthood.  Without proper sex education, many young people will be unprepared for the realities of adult life and may make poor decisions regarding their sexual health.  This could result in unwanted pregnancies, sexually transmitted diseases, and other negative consequences.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that sex education should be taught in schools.  It is important for young people to learn about sex so that they can make informed decisions about their sexual health.

Thank you for your time.\n\nNow let me tell you why I think sex education should not be taught in schools at all.  Sex is indeed a private matter that should be discussed between parents and their children.  Teaching sex education in schools will only lead to more teenagers having sex and getting pregnant or contracting sexually transmitted diseases.  These arguments may have some merit, but I still believe that sex education is necessary in order to prepare young people for adulthood.

It is important for young people to learn about sex so that they can make informed decisions about their sexual health.

Sex is indeed a private matter that should be discussed between parents and their children.  Teaching sex education in schools will only lead to more teenagers having sex and getting pregnant or contracting sexually transmitted diseases.

            "There are a lot of troubling things going on with these activists finding willing audiences in corrupt politicians like Kathleen Wynne.  Just as they are trying to censor this brilliant and refreshing documentary on Dr. Zucker, (I'd encourage you to look into this heroic professional who was black listed by these career, taxpayer bleeding, social justice warriors and militant activists), they did the same thing with the Ontario Sex Ed curriculum.  They banned any parental feedback and deferred to the activist themselves to review it and approve it, despite the fact that it heavily promotes gender diasphora, and the fantasies of Ben Levin.\n\nThese totalitarians operate under the guise of gaining equality for a supposed marginalized group, but are willing to go scorched earth with your children to get what they want.  If you don't go along you're branded a homophobe or ignorant, but ask them for any scientific evidence and they'll trot out some junk science and personally attack you.\n\nThe people who oppose the sex ed curriculum are doing so because they don't want their kids to learn about homosexuality.
