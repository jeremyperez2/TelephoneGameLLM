We need more tools like the internet that allow us to share information and ideas freely without fear of reprisal from those in power.

We need more people who are willing to put their own safety and well-being at risk in order to defend the rights of others.  We need more people who are willing to fight for what is right, even when it is unpopular or inconvenient.\n\nOnly by standing together and speaking out can we hope to make a difference.

Only by coming together can we hope to build a better future for ourselves and for our children.\n\nSo let us continue to stand up for what is right, and let us continue to fight against those who would seek to silence us.  Let us continue to work together to create a world where everyone is free to live their lives as they see fit, without fear of persecution or discrimination.  And let us never forget that only by coming together can we hope to build a better future for ourselves and for our children."
