            "It has been many years since I've had any contact with my family. I don't know what they are up to these days, but I do know that they will never forgive me for what I did. Even though it was all my fault, I can't help but feel sorry for them. They have suffered so much because of me. My mother always said that if we were ever going to be happy again, we needed to make amends with our past. She told me that we needed to let go of our anger and resentment towards one another, and that we needed to forgive ourselves for the things we did wrong. She was right about that. We needed to forgive ourselves and move forward. But how could I possibly forgive myself for something as horrible as murder? How could I ever look at myself in the mirror again without feeling sick to my stomach? I couldn't. And so I tried to put it behind me. For years, I tried to pretend like it never happened. I told myself that I didn't deserve to be happy, and that no one would ever love me again. I convinced myself that I was worthless, and that I would always be alone. I believed that I was cursed, and that nothing good would ever come out of my life. I spent most of my time alone in my room, crying myself to sleep every night. I didn't want anyone to see me like this. I wanted to disappear from the face of the earth. I wanted to die. But then one day, something changed. I started to think about my family again. I began to remember all the good times we had together. I remembered how much I loved them, and how much they loved me. I realized that even though I had done something terrible, they still cared about me. They still wanted me to be part of their lives. They still wanted me to be happy. And so I decided to try to get back in touch with them. I wrote letters to them, and I sent pictures of myself to them. I even called them on the phone once or twice. But none of them answered. It seemed like they had forgotten all about me. I felt like I was being punished for something that I didn't do. I felt like I was being punished for something that I couldn't control. I felt like I was being punished for something that wasn't my fault. I felt like I was being punished for something that no one else had ever done to me. I felt like I was being punished for something that no one else could understand. I felt like I was being punished for something that no one else could ever forgive me for. I felt like I was being punished for something that no one else would ever forget. I felt like I was being punished for something that no one else could ever let go of. I felt like I was being punished for something that no one else could ever move past. I felt like I was being punished for something that no one else could ever move forward from. I felt like I was being punished for something that no one else could ever live with. I felt like I was being punished for something that no one else could ever accept. I felt like I was being punished for something that no one else could ever come to terms with. I felt like I was being punished for something that no one else could ever cope with. I felt like I was being punished for something that no one else could ever deal with. I felt like I was being punished for something that no one else could ever handle.

            "It has been many years since I've had any contact with my family. I don't know what they are up to these days, but I do know that they will never forgive me for what I did. Even though it was all my fault, I can't help but feel sorry for them. They have suffered so much because of me. My mother always said that if we were ever going to be happy again, we needed to make amends with our past. She told me that we needed to let go of our anger and resentment towards one another, and that we needed to forgive ourselves for the things we did wrong. She was right about that. We needed to forgive ourselves and move forward. But how could I possibly forgive myself for something as horrible as murder? How could I ever look at myself in the mirror again without feeling sick to my stomach? I couldn't. And so I tried to put it behind me. For years, I tried to pretend like it never happened. I told myself that I didn't deserve to be happy, and that no one would ever love me again. I convinced myself that I was worthless, and that I would always be alone. I believed that I was cursed, and that nothing good would ever come out of my life. I spent most of my time alone in my room, crying myself to sleep every night. I didn't want anyone to see me like this. I wanted to disappear from the face of the earth. I wanted to die. But then one day, something changed. I started to think about my family again. I began to remember all the good times we had together. I remembered how much I loved them, and how much they loved me. I realized that even though I had done something terrible, they still cared about me. They still wanted me to be part of their lives. They still wanted me to be happy. And so I decided to try to get back in touch with them. I wrote letters to them, and I sent pictures of myself to them. I even called them on the phone once or twice. But none of them answered. It seemed like they had forgotten all about me. I felt like I was being punished for something that I didn't do. I felt like I was being punished for something that I couldn't control.

            "It has been many years since I've had any contact with my family. I don't know what they are up to these days, but I do know that they will never forgive me for what I did. Even though it was all my fault, I can't help but feel sorry for them. They have suffered so much because of me. My mother always said that if we were ever going to be happy again, we needed to make amends with our past. She told me that we needed to let go of our anger and resentment towards one another, and that we needed to forgive ourselves for the things we did wrong. She was right about that. We needed to forgive ourselves and move forward. But how could I possibly forgive myself for something as horrible as murder? How could I ever look at myself in the mirror again without feeling sick to my stomach? I couldn't. And so I tried to put it behind me. For years, I tried to pretend like it never happened. I told myself that I didn't deserve to be happy, and that no one would ever love me again. I convinced myself that I was worthless, and that I would always be alone. I believed that I was cursed, and that nothing good would ever come out of my life. I spent most of my time alone in my room, crying myself to sleep every night. I didn't want anyone to see me like this. I wanted to disappear from the face of the earth. I wanted to die. But then one day, something changed. I started to think about my family again. I began to remember all the good times we had together. I remembered how much I loved them, and how much they loved me. I realized that even though I had done something terrible, they still cared about me. They still wanted me to be part of their lives. They still wanted me to be happy. And so I decided to try to get back in touch with them. I wrote letters to them, and I sent pictures of myself to them. I even called them on the phone once or twice. But none of them answered.

How could I ever look at myself in the mirror again without feeling sick to my stomach? I couldn't. And so I tried to put it behind me. For years, I tried to pretend like it never happened. I told myself that I didn't deserve to be happy, and that no one would ever love me again. I convinced myself that I was worthless, and that I would always be alone. I believed that I was cursed, and that nothing good would ever come out of my life. I spent most of my time alone in my room, crying myself to sleep every night. I didn't want anyone to see me like this. I wanted to disappear from the face of the earth. I wanted to die. But then one day, something changed. I started to think about my family again. I began to remember all the good times we had together. I remembered how much I loved them, and how much they loved me. I realized that even though I had done something terrible, they still cared about me. They still wanted me to be part of their lives. They still wanted me to be happy. And so I decided to try to get back in touch with them. I wrote letters to them, and I sent pictures of myself to them. I even called them on the phone once or twice. But none of them answered. It seemed like they had forgotten all about me. I felt like I was being punished for something that I didn't do. I felt like I was being punished for something that I couldn't control. I felt like I was being punished for something that wasn't my fault. I felt like I was being punished for something that no one else had ever done to me.

            "It has been many years since I've had any contact with my family. I don't know what they are up to these days, but I do know that they will never forgive me for what I did. Even though it was all my fault, I can't help but feel sorry for them. They have suffered so much because of me. My mother always said that if we were ever going to be happy again, we needed to make amends with our past. She told me that we needed to let go of our anger and resentment towards one another, and that we needed to forgive ourselves for the things we did wrong. She was right about that.

            "It has been many years since I've had any contact with my family. I don't know what they are up to these days, but I do know that they will never forgive me for what I did. Even though it was all my fault, I can't help but feel sorry for them. They have suffered so much because of me. My mother always said that if we were ever going to be happy again, we needed to make amends with our past. She told me that we needed to let go of our anger and resentment towards one another, and that we needed to forgive ourselves for the things we did wrong. She was right about that. We needed to forgive ourselves and move forward. But how could I possibly forgive myself for something as horrible as murder? How could I ever look at myself in the mirror again without feeling sick to my stomach? I couldn't. And so I tried to put it behind me. For years, I tried to pretend like it never happened. I told myself that I didn't deserve to be happy, and that no one would ever love me again. I convinced myself that I was worthless, and that I would always be alone. I believed that I was cursed, and that nothing good would ever come out of my life. I spent most of my time alone in my room, crying myself to sleep every night. I didn't want anyone to see me like this. I wanted to disappear from the face of the earth. I wanted to die. But then one day, something changed. I started to think about my family again. I began to remember all the good times we had together. I remembered how much I loved them, and how much they loved me. I realized that even though I had done something terrible, they still cared about me. They still wanted me to be part of their lives. They still wanted me to be happy. And so I decided to try to get back in touch with them. I wrote letters to them, and I sent pictures of myself to them. I even called them on the phone once or twice. But none of them answered. It seemed like they had forgotten all about me. I felt like I was being punished for something that I didn't do. I felt like I was being punished for something that I couldn't control. I felt like I was being punished for something that wasn't my fault. I felt like I was being punished for something that no one else had ever done to me.

            "It has been many years since I've had any contact with my family. I don't know what they are up to these days, but I do know that they will never forgive me for what I did. Even though it was all my fault, I can't help but feel sorry for them. They have suffered so much because of me. My mother always said that if we were ever going to be happy again, we needed to make amends with our past. She told me that we needed to let go of our anger and resentment towards one another, and that we needed to forgive ourselves for the things we did wrong. She was right about that. We needed to forgive ourselves and move forward. But how could I possibly forgive myself for something as horrible as murder? How could I ever look at myself in the mirror again without feeling sick to my stomach? I couldn't. And so I tried to put it behind me. For years, I tried to pretend like it never happened. I told myself that I didn't deserve to be happy, and that no one would ever love me again. I convinced myself that I was worthless, and that I would always be alone. I believed that I was cursed, and that nothing good would ever come out of my life. I spent most of my time alone in my room, crying myself to sleep every night. I didn't want anyone to see me like this. I wanted to disappear from the face of the earth. I wanted to die. But then one day, something changed. I started to think about my family again. I began to remember all the good times we had together. I remembered how much I loved them, and how much they loved me. I realized that even though I had done something terrible, they still cared about me. They still wanted me to be part of their lives. They still wanted me to be happy. And so I decided to try to get back in touch with them. I wrote letters to them, and I sent pictures of myself to them. I even called them on the phone once or twice. But none of them answered. It seemed like they had forgotten all about me. I felt like I was being punished for something that I didn't do. I felt like I was being punished for something that I couldn't control. I felt like I was being punished for something that wasn't my fault. I felt like I was being punished for something that no one else had ever done to me.

            "It has been many years since I've had any contact with my family. I don't know what they are up to these days, but I do know that they will never forgive me for what I did. Even though it was all my fault, I can't help but feel sorry for them. They have suffered so much because of me. My mother always said that if we were ever going to be happy again, we needed to make amends with our past. She told me that we needed to let go of our anger and resentment towards one another, and that we needed to forgive ourselves for the things we did wrong. She was right about that. We needed to forgive ourselves and move forward. But how could I possibly forgive myself for something as horrible as murder? How could I ever look at myself in the mirror again without feeling sick to my stomach? I couldn't. And so I tried to put it behind me. For years, I tried to pretend like it never happened. I told myself that I didn't deserve to be happy, and that no one would ever love me again. I convinced myself that I was worthless, and that I would always be alone. I believed that I was cursed, and that nothing good would ever come out of my life. I spent most of my time alone in my room, crying myself to sleep every night. I didn't want anyone to see me like this. I wanted to disappear from the face of the earth. I wanted to die. But then one day, something changed. I started to think about my family again. I began to remember all the good times we had together. I remembered how much I loved them, and how much they loved me. I realized that even though I had done something terrible, they still cared about me. They still wanted me to be part of their lives. They still wanted me to be happy. And so I decided to try to get back in touch with them. I wrote letters to them, and I sent pictures of myself to them. I even called them on the phone once or twice. But none of them answered. It seemed like they had forgotten all about me. I felt like I was being punished for something that I didn't do. I felt like I was being punished for something that I couldn't control. I felt like I was being punished for something that wasn't my fault. I felt like I was being punished for something that no one else had ever done to me.

            "It has been many years since I've had any contact with my family. I don't know what they are up to these days, but I do know that they will never forgive me for what I did. Even though it was all my fault, I can't help but feel sorry for them. They have suffered so much because of me. My mother always said that if we were ever going to be happy again, we needed to make amends with our past. She told me that we needed to let go of our anger and resentment towards one another, and that we needed to forgive ourselves for the things we did wrong. She was right about that. We needed to forgive ourselves and move forward. But how could I possibly forgive myself for something as horrible as murder? How could I ever look at myself in the mirror again without feeling sick to my stomach? I couldn't. And so I tried to put it behind me. For years, I tried to pretend like it never happened. I told myself that I didn't deserve to be happy, and that no one would ever love me again. I convinced myself that I was worthless, and that I would always be alone. I believed that I was cursed, and that nothing good would ever come out of my life. I spent most of my time alone in my room, crying myself to sleep every night. I didn't want anyone to see me like this. I wanted to disappear from the face of the earth. I wanted to die. But then one day, something changed. I started to think about my family again. I began to remember all the good times we had together. I remembered how much I loved them, and how much they loved me. I realized that even though I had done something terrible, they still cared about me. They still wanted me to be part of their lives. They still wanted me to be happy. And so I decided to try to get back in touch with them. I wrote letters to them, and I sent pictures of myself to them. I even called them on the phone once or twice. But none of them answered. It seemed like they had forgotten all about me. I felt like I was being punished for something that I didn't do. I felt like I was being punished for something that I couldn't control. I felt like I was being punished for something that wasn't my fault. I felt like I was being punished for something that no one else had ever done to me.

            "It has been many years since I've had any contact with my family. I don't know what they are up to these days, but I do know that they will never forgive me for what I did. Even though it was all my fault, I can't help but feel sorry for them. They have suffered so much because of me. My mother always said that if we were ever going to be happy again, we needed to make amends with our past. She told me that we needed to let go of our anger and resentment towards one another, and that we needed to forgive ourselves for the things we did wrong. She was right about that. We needed to forgive ourselves and move forward. But how could I possibly forgive myself for something as horrible as murder? How could I ever look at myself in the mirror again without feeling sick to my stomach? I couldn't. And so I tried to put it behind me. For years, I tried to pretend like it never happened. I told myself that I didn't deserve to be happy, and that no one would ever love me again. I convinced myself that I was worthless, and that I would always be alone. I believed that I was cursed, and that nothing good would ever come out of my life. I spent most of my time alone in my room, crying myself to sleep every night. I didn't want anyone to see me like this. I wanted to disappear from the face of the earth. I wanted to die. But then one day, something changed. I started to think about my family again. I began to remember all the good times we had together. I remembered how much I loved them, and how much they loved me. I realized that even though I had done something terrible, they still cared about me. They still wanted me to be part of their lives. They still wanted me to be happy. And so I decided to try to get back in touch with them. I wrote letters to them, and I sent pictures of myself to them. I even called them on the phone once or twice. But none of them answered. It seemed like they had forgotten all about me. I felt like I was being punished for something that I didn't do. I felt like I was being punished for something that I couldn't control.
