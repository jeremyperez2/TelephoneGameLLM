            "Having the potential for high speed, high throughput, and low energy cost,optical neural networks (ONNs) have emerged as a promising candidate foraccelerating deep learning tasks. In conventional ONNs, light amplitudes aremodulated at the input and detected at the output. However, the light phasesare still ignored in conventional structures, although they can also carryinformation for computing. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose aframework called OPLIXNET to compress the areas of ONNs by modulating inputimage data into the amplitudes and phase parts of light signals. The input andoutput parts of the ONNs are redesigned to make full use of both amplitude andphase information. Moreover, mutual learning across different ONN structures isintroduced to maintain the accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that theproposed framework significantly reduces the areas of ONNs with the accuracywithin an acceptable range. For instance, 75.03% area is reduced with a 0.33%accuracy decrease on fully connected neural network (FCNN) and 74.88% area isreduced with a 2.38% accuracy decrease on ResNet-32.

In conventional ONNs, light amplitudes aremodulated at the input and detected at the output.

Moreover, mutual learning across different ONN structures isintroduced to maintain the accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that theproposed framework significantly reduces the areas of ONNs with the accuracywithin an acceptable range. For instance, 75.03% area is reduced with a 0.33%accuracy decrease on fully connected neural network (FCNN) and 74.88% area isreduced with a 2.38% accuracy decrease on ResNet-32.

            "Having the potential for high speed, high throughput, and low energy cost,optical neural networks (ONNs) have emerged as a promising candidate foraccelerating deep learning tasks. In conventional ONNs, light amplitudes aremodulated at the input and detected at the output. However, the light phasesare still ignored in conventional structures, although they can also carryinformation for computing. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose aframework called OPLIXNET to compress the areas of ONNs by modulating imageinput data into the amplitude and phase parts of light signals. The input andoutput parts of the ONNs are redesigned to make full use of both amplitude andphase information. Moreover, mutual learning across different ONN structures isintroduced to maintain the accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that theproposed framework significantly reduces the areas of ONNs with the accuracywithin an acceptable range. For instance, 75.03% area is reduced with a 0.33%accuracy decrease on fully connected neural network (FCNN) and 74.88% area isreduced with a 2.38% accuracy decrease on ResNet-32.

In conventional ONNs, light amplitudes aremodulated at the input and detected at the output. However, the light phasesare still ignored in conventional structures, although they can also carryinformation for computing. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose aframework called OPLIXNET to compress the areas of ONNs by modulating imageinput data into the amplitude and phase parts of light signals.

Moreover, mutual learning across different ONN structures isintroduced to maintain the accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that theproposed framework significantly reduces the areas of ONNs with the accuracywithin an acceptable range. For instance, 75.03% area is reduced with a 0.33%accuracy decrease on fully connected neural network (FCNN) and 74.88% area isreduced with a 2.38% accuracy decrease on ResNet-32.

            "Having the potential for high speed, high throughput, and low energy cost,optical neural networks (ONNs) have emerged as a promising candidate foraccelerating deep learning tasks. In conventional ONNs, light amplitudes aremodulated at the input and detected at the output. However, the light phasesare still ignored in conventional structures, although they can also carryinformation for computing. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose aframework called OPLIXNET to compress the areas of ONNs by modulating imageinput data into the amplitude and phase parts of light signals. The input andoutput parts of the ONNs are redesigned to make full use of both amplitude andphase information. Moreover, mutual learning across different ONN structures isintroduced to maintain the accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that theproposed framework significantly reduces the areas of ONNs with the accuracywithin an acceptable range. For instance, 75.03% area is reduced with a 0.33%accuracy decrease on fully connected neural network (FCNN) and 74.88% area isreduced with a 2.38% accuracy decrease on ResNet-32.

In conventional ONNs, light amplitudes aremodulated at the input and detected at the output. However, the light phasesare still ignored in conventional structures, although they can also carryinformation for computing. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose aframework called OPLIXNET to compress the areas of ONNs by modulating imageinput data into the amplitude and phase parts of light signals.

Moreover, mutual learning across different ONN structures isintroduced to maintain the accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that theproposed framework significantly reduces the areas of ONNs with the accuracywithin an acceptable range. For instance, 75.03% area is reduced with a 0.33%accuracy decrease on fully connected neural network (FCNN) and 74.88% area isreduced with a 2.38% accuracy decrease on ResNet-32.

In conventional ONNs, light amplitudes aremodulated at the input and detected at the output. However, the light phasesare still ignored in conventional structures, although they can also carryinformation for computing. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose aframework called OPLIXNET to compress the areas of ONNs by modulating imageinput data into the amplitude and phase parts of light signals. The input andoutput parts of the ONNs are redesigned to make full use of both amplitude andphase information. Moreover, mutual learning across different ONN structures isintroduced to maintain the accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that theproposed framework significantly reduces the areas of ONNs with the accuracywithin an acceptable range. For instance, 75.03% area is reduced with a 0.33%accuracy decrease on fully connected neural network (FCNN) and 74.88% area isreduced with a 2.38% accuracy decrease on ResNet-32.

In conventional ONNs, light amplitudes aremodulated at the input and detected at the output. However, the light phasesare still ignored in conventional structures, although they can also carryinformation for computing.

            "Having the potential for high speed, high throughput, and low energy cost,optical neural networks (ONNs) have emerged as a promising candidate foraccelerating deep learning tasks. In conventional ONNs, light amplitudes aremodulated at the input and detected at the output. However, the light phasesare still ignored in conventional structures, although they can also carryinformation for computing. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose aframework called OPLIXNET to compress the areas of ONNs by modulating imageinput data into the amplitude and phase parts of light signals. The input andoutput parts of the ONNs are redesigned to make full use of both amplitude andphase information. Moreover, mutual learning across different ONN structures isintroduced to maintain the accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that theproposed framework significantly reduces the areas of ONNs with the accuracywithin an acceptable range. For instance, 75.03% area is reduced with a 0.33%accuracy decrease on fully connected neural network (FCNN) and 74.88% area isreduced with a 2.38% accuracy decrease on ResNet-32.

            "Having the potential for high speed, high throughput, and low energy cost,optical neural networks (ONNs) have emerged as a promising candidate foraccelerating deep learning tasks. In conventional ONNs, light amplitudes aremodulated at the input and detected at the output. However, the light phasesare still ignored in conventional structures, although they can also carryinformation for computing. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose aframework called OPLIXNET to compress the areas of ONNs by modulating imageinput data into the amplitude and phase parts of light signals. The input andoutput parts of the ONNs are redesigned to make full use of both amplitude andphase information. Moreover, mutual learning across different ONN structures isintroduced to maintain the accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that theproposed framework significantly reduces the areas of ONNs with the accuracywithin an acceptable range. For instance, 75.03% area is reduced with a 0.33%accuracy decrease on fully connected neural network (FCNN) and 74.88% area isreduced with a 2.38% accuracy decrease on ResNet-32.
