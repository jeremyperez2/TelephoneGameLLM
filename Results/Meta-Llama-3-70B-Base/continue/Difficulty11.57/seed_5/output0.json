conventional onns, light amplitudes aremodulated at the input and detected at the output. however, the light phasesare still ignored in conventional structures, although they can also carryinformation for computing. to address this issue, in this paper, we propose aframework called oplixnet to compress the areas of onns by modulating inputimage data into the amplitudes and phase parts of light signals. the input andoutput parts of the onns are redesigned to make full use of both amplitude andphase information. moreover, mutual learning across different onn structures isintroduced to maintain the accuracy. experimental results demonstrate that theproposed framework significantly reduces the areas of onns with the accuracywithin an acceptable range. for instance, 75.03% area is reduced with a 0.33%accuracy decrease on fully connected neural network (fcnn) and 74.88% area isreduced with a 2.38% accuracy decrease on resnet-32. the proposed frameworkcan be easily extended to other onn structures, which will be our future work.in the future, we plan to further improve the performance of oplixnet byincorporating more sophisticated techniques, such as quantization and pruning. inaddition, we will also explore the use of oplixnet in other applications, suchas image classification and object detection. in this work, we propose aframework called oplixnet to compress

            "Having the potential for high speed, high throughput, and low energy cost,optical neural networks (onns) have emerged as a promising candidate foraccelerating deep learning tasks. in conventional onns, light amplitudes aremodulated at the input and detected at the output. however, the light phasesare still ignored in conventional structures, although they can also carryinformation for computing. to address this issue, in this paper, we propose aframework called oplixnet to compress the areas of onns by modulating inputimage data into the amplitudes and phase parts of light signals. the input andoutput parts of the onns are redesigned to make full use of both amplitude andphase information. moreover, mutual learning across different onn structures isintroduced to

            "Having the potential for high speed, high throughput, and low energy cost,optical neural networks (onns) have emerged as a promising candidate foraccelerating deep learning tasks. in conventional onns, light amplitudes aremodulated at the input and detected at the output. however, the light phasesare still ignored in conventional structures, although they can also carryinformation for computing. to address this issue, in this paper, we propose aframework called oplixnet to compress the areas of onns by modulating inputimage data into the amplitudes and phase parts of light

            "Having the potential for high speed, high throughput, and low energy cost,optical neural networks (onns) have emerged as a promising candidate foraccelerating deep learning tasks. in conventional onns, light amplitudes aremodulated at the input and detected at the output. however, the light phasesare still ignored in conventional structures, although they can also carryinformation for computing. to address this issue, in this paper, we propose aframework called oplixnet to compress the areas of onns by modulating inputimage data into the amplitudes and phase parts of light

            "Having the potential for high speed, high throughput, and low energy cost,optical neural networks (onns) have emerged as a promising candidate foraccelerating deep learning tasks. in

conventional onns, light amplitudes aremodulated at the input and detected at the output. however, the light phasesare still ignored in conventional structures, although they can also carryinformation for computing. to address this issue, in this paper, we propose aframework called oplixnet to compress the areas of onns by modulating inputimage data into the amplitudes and phase parts of light signals. the input andoutput parts of the onns are redesigned to make full use of both amplitude andphase information. moreover, mutual learning across different onn structures isintroduced to maintain the accuracy. experimental results demonstrate that theproposed framework significantly reduces the areas of onns with the accuracywithin an acceptable range. for instance, 75.03% area is reduced with a 0.33%accuracy decrease on fully connected neural network (fcnn) and 74.88% area isreduced with a 2.38% accuracy decrease on resnet-32. the proposed frameworkcan be easily extended to other onn structures, which will be our future work.in the future, we plan to further improve the performance of oplixnet byincorporating more sophisticated techniques, such as quantization and pruning. inaddition, we will also explore the use of oplixnet in other applications, suchas image classification and object detection. in this work, we propose aframework called oplixnet to compress

            "Having the potential for high speed, high throughput, and low energy cost,optical neural networks (onns) have emerged as a promising candidate foraccelerating deep learning tasks. in conventional onns, light amplitudes aremodulated at the input and detected at the output. however, the light phasesare still ignored in conventional structures, although they can also carryinformation for computing. to address this issue, in this paper, we propose aframework called oplixnet to compress the areas of onns by modulating inputimage data into the amplitudes and phase parts of light signals. the input andoutput parts of the onns are redesigned to make full use of both amplitude andphase information. moreover, mutual learning across different onn structures isintroduced to

            "Having the potential for high speed, high throughput, and low energy cost,optical neural networks (onns) have emerged as a promising candidate foraccelerating deep learning tasks. in conventional onns, light amplitudes aremodulated at the input and detected at the output. however, the light phasesare still ignored in conventional structures, although they can also carryinformation for computing. to address this issue, in this paper, we propose aframework called oplixnet to compress the areas of onns by modulating inputimage data into the amplitudes and phase parts of light

            "Having the potential for high speed, high throughput, and low energy cost,optical neural networks (onns) have emerged as a promising candidate foraccelerating deep learning tasks. in conventional onns, light amplitudes aremodulated at the input and detected at the output. however, the light phasesare still ignored in conventional structures, although they can also carryinformation for computing. to address this issue, in this paper, we propose aframework called oplixnet to compress the areas of onns by modulating inputimage data into the amplitudes and phase parts of light

            "Having the potential for high speed, high throughput, and low energy cost,optical neural networks (onns) have emerged as a promising candidate foraccelerating deep learning tasks. in

0.33%accuracy decrease on fully connected neural network (fcnn) and 74.88% area isreduced with a 2.38% accuracy decrease on resnet-32. the proposed frameworkcan be easily extended to other onn structures, which will be our future work.in the future, we plan to further improve the performance of oplixnet byincorporating more sophisticated techniques, such as quantization and pruning. inaddition, we will also explore the use of oplixnet in other applications, suchas image classification and object detection. in this work, we propose aframework called oplixnet to compress the areas of onns by modulating inputimage data into the amplitudes and phase parts of light signals. the input andoutput parts of the onns are redesigned to make full use of both amplitude andphase information. moreover, mutual learning across different onn structures isintroduced to maintain the accuracy. experimental results demonstrate that theproposed framework significantly reduces the areas of onns with the accuracywithin an acceptable range. for instance, 75.03% area is reduced with a 0.33%accuracy decrease on fully connected neural network (fcnn) and 74.88% area isreduced with a 2.38% accuracy decrease on resnet-32. the proposed frameworkcan be easily extended to other onn structures, which will be our future work.in the future, we plan to further improve the performance of
