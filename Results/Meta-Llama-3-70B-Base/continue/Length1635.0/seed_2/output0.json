The writers were Sam Hancock and Sean Seddon, and we had Madeline Halpert and Kayla Epstein in court.\n\nCourt doesn't sit on Wednesday, so we'll be back on Thursday, when Stormy Daniels will once again take to the stand to continue her testimony.\n\nOn Thursday, the court heard from several witnesses who testified about their interactions with Daniels and her former lawyer Michael Avenatti. \n\nOne of those witnesses was David Pecker, the former CEO of American Media Inc., which published the National Enquirer. Pecker testified that he had met with Daniels' former lawyer Michael Avenatti in late 2018 to discuss a potential story about Daniels' alleged affair with Trump. He said Avenatti wanted the company to pay Daniels $1 million for her silence on the matter. Pecker said he turned down the offer.\n\nAnother witness was Keith Davidson, Daniels' former lawyer who represented her during her negotiations with American Media Inc. over the alleged affair. Davidson testified that he had been pressured by Avenatti to sign a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) with Daniels that would have prevented her from speaking publicly about the affair. He said Avenatti threatened to release information about Davidson's own alleged sexual misconduct if he didn't cooperate.\n\nThe final witness was Julie Swetnick, who claimed in a sworn affidavit that she had seen Trump and other men engage in sexual misconduct at parties in the 1980s and 1990s. Swetnick testified that she had only recently come forward with her allegations because she had been afraid of retaliation.\n\nIn response to the testimony, Daniels took the stand to refute many of the claims made by Pecker and Davidson. She denied that she had ever been paid to stay silent about the alleged affair and said she had only signed the NDA because she felt threatened by Avenatti.\n\nThe court adjourned until Friday, when it is expected that Avenatti will take the stand to give his own testimony."

Prosecutors were also told to limit their questions regarding the salacious details of her alleged sexual encounter with Trump (which Trump has denied ever taking place).\n\nHere's our full wrap of what happened in court today.\n\nThis page was edited by Tiffany Wertheimer, Lisa Lambert, Brandon Livesay and Phil McCausland. The writers were Sam Hancock and Sean Seddon, and we had Madeline Halpert and Kayla Epstein in court.\n\nCourt doesn't sit on Wednesday, so we'll be back on Thursday, when Stormy Daniels will once again take to the stand to continue her testimony.\n\nOn Thursday, the court heard from several witnesses who testified about their interactions with Daniels and her former lawyer Michael Avenatti. \n\nOne of those witnesses was David Pecker, the former CEO of American Media Inc., which published the National Enquirer. Pecker testified that he had met with Daniels' former lawyer Michael Avenatti in late 2018 to discuss a potential story about Daniels' alleged affair with Trump. He said Avenatti wanted the company to pay Daniels $1 million for her silence on the matter. Pecker said he turned down the offer.\n\nAnother witness was Keith Davidson, Daniels' former lawyer who represented her during her negotiations with American Media Inc. over the alleged affair. Davidson testified that he had been pressured by Avenatti to sign a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) with Daniels that would have prevented her from speaking publicly about the affair. He said Avenatti threatened to release information about Davidson's own alleged sexual misconduct if he didn't cooperate.\n\nThe final witness was Julie Swetnick, who claimed in a sworn affidavit that she had seen Trump and other men engage in sexual misconduct at parties in the 1980s and 1990s. Swetnick testified that she had only recently come forward with her allegations because she had been afraid of retaliation.\n\nIn response to the testimony, Daniels took the stand to refute many of the claims made by Pecker and Davidson. She denied that she had ever been paid to stay silent about the alleged affair and said she had only signed the NDA because she felt threatened by Avenatti.\n\nThe court adjourned until Friday, when it is expected that Avenatti will take the stand to give his own testimony."

            "Thanks for joining our live coverage on an extraordinary day in court, with adult-film star Stormy Daniels taking the stand.\n\nIt was a tense courtroom, with Daniels warned to dial back her comments at times. Prosecutors were also told to limit their questions regarding the salacious details of her alleged sexual encounter with Trump (which Trump has denied ever taking place).\n\nHere's our full wrap of what happened in court today.\n\nThis page was edited by Tiffany Wertheimer, Lisa Lambert, Brandon Livesay and Phil McCausland. The writers were Sam Hancock and Sean Seddon, and we had Madeline Halpert and Kayla Epstein in court.\n\nCourt doesn't sit on Wednesday, so we'll be back on Thursday, when Stormy Daniels will once again take to the stand to continue her testimony.\n\nOn Thursday, the court heard from several witnesses who testified about their interactions with Daniels and her former lawyer Michael Avenatti. \n\nOne of those witnesses was David Pecker, the former CEO of American Media Inc., which published the National Enquirer. Pecker testified that he had met with Daniels' former lawyer Michael Avenatti in late 2018 to discuss a potential story about Daniels' alleged affair with Trump. He said Avenatti wanted the company to pay Daniels $1 million for her silence on the matter. Pecker said he turned down the offer.\n\nAnother witness was Keith Davidson, Daniels' former lawyer who represented her during her negotiations with American Media Inc. over the alleged affair. Davidson testified that he had been pressured by Avenatti to sign a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) with Daniels that would have prevented her from speaking publicly about the affair. He said Avenatti threatened to release information about Davidson's own alleged sexual misconduct if he didn't cooperate.\n\nThe final witness was Julie Swetnick, who claimed in a sworn affidavit that she had seen Trump and other men engage in sexual misconduct at parties in the 1980s and 1990s. Swetnick testified that she had only recently come forward with her allegations because she had been afraid of retaliation.\n\nIn response to the testimony, Daniels took the stand to refute many of the claims made by Pecker and Davidson. She denied that she had ever been paid to stay silent about the alleged affair and said she had only signed the NDA because she felt threatened by Avenatti.\n\nThe court adjourned until Friday, when it is expected that Avenatti will take the stand to give his own testimony.\n\nOn Friday, Avenatti took the stand to give his own testimony. He denied all the allegations made against him by Daniels, Pecker, and Davidson. He said that he had only been trying to protect Daniels' interests and that he had never pressured her to sign the NDA.\n\nThe court adjourned until Monday, when closing arguments are expected to be made.\n\nOn Monday, closing arguments were made by both sides. The prosecution argued that Avenatti had used his position as Daniels' lawyer to extort money from American Media Inc. and that he had used threats of sexual misconduct to pressure Davidson into signing the NDA. They also argued that Avenatti had used his position as a lawyer to gain access to confidential information about Trump and then used that information to try to blackmail him.\n\nThe defense argued that Avenatti had only been trying to protect Daniels' interests and that he had never threatened or pressured anyone to do anything. They also argued that Avenatti had only been trying to negotiate a fair settlement for Daniels and that he had never tried to extort money from anyone.\n\nAfter the closing arguments, the jury began deliberations.

            "On Tuesday, the court heard testimony from several witnesses who testified about their interactions with Daniels and her former lawyer Michael Avenatti. One of those witnesses was Keith Davidson, Daniels' former lawyer who represented her during her negotiations with American Media Inc. over the alleged affair. He testified that he had been pressured by Avenatti to sign a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) with Daniels that would have prevented her from speaking publicly about the affair. He said Avenatti threatened to release information about Davidson's own alleged sexual misconduct if he didn't cooperate. The final witness was Julie Swetnick, who claimed in a sworn affidavit that she had seen Trump and other men engage in sexual misconduct at parties in the 1980s and 1990s. Swetnick testified that she had only recently come forward with her allegations because she had been afraid of retaliation. In response to the testimony, Daniels took the stand to refute many of the claims made by Pecker and Davidson. She denied that she had ever been paid to stay silent about the alleged affair and said she had only signed the NDA because she felt threatened by Avenatti.
