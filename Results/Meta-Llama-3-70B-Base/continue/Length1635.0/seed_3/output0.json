            "Thanks for joining our live coverage on an extraordinary day in court, with adult-film star Stormy Daniels taking the stand.\n\nIt was a tense courtroom, with Daniels warned to dial back her comments at times. Prosecutors were also told to limit their questions regarding the salacious details of her alleged sexual encounter with Trump (which Trump has denied ever taking place).\n\nHere's our full wrap of what happened in court today.\n\nThis page was edited by Tiffany Wertheimer, Lisa Lambert, Brandon Livesay and Phil McCausland. The writers were Sam Hancock and Sean Seddon, and we had Madeline Halpert and Kayla Epstein in court.\n\nCourt doesn't sit on Wednesday, so we'll be back on Thursday, when Stormy Daniels will once again take to the stand to continue her testimony.\n\nStay tuned for more updates from the courtroom!\n\nIn other news, a new study has found that people who use social media are more likely to be lonely and depressed.

            "Thanks for joining our live coverage on an extraordinary day in court, with adult-film star Stormy Daniels taking the stand.\n\nIt was a tense courtroom, with Daniels warned to dial back her comments at times. Prosecutors were also told to limit their questions regarding the salacious details of her alleged sexual encounter with Trump (which Trump has denied ever taking place).\n\nHere's our full wrap of what happened in court today.\n\nThis page was edited by Tiffany Wertheimer, Lisa Lambert, Brandon Livesay and Phil McCausland. The writers were Sam Hancock and Sean Seddon, and we had Madeline Halpert and Kayla Epstein in court.\n\nCourt doesn't sit on Wednesday, so we'll be back on Thursday, when Stormy Daniels will once again take to the stand to continue her testimony.\n\nStay tuned for more updates from the courtroom!\n\nIn other news, a new study has found that people who use social media are more likely to be lonely and depressed. The study, which was conducted by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania, looked at data from over 1,500 people aged 18 to 24.\n\nThe results showed that those who used social media for more than two hours a day were more likely to report feeling lonely and depressed. The study also found that people who used social media for more than two hours a day were more likely to have fewer close friends and to be less satisfied with their lives.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Jean Twenge, said that the findings suggest that social media use may be contributing to the loneliness and depression epidemic among young people.\n\n\"The results of this study are concerning,\" she said. \"Social media use is associated with a number of negative outcomes, including loneliness and depression. These findings suggest that social media use may be playing a role in the loneliness and depression epidemic among young people.\"\n\nShe added that more research is needed to determine the exact cause of the link between social media use and loneliness and depression. \"We need to understand more about how social media use affects young people's mental health,\" she said. \"Until we do, we should be cautious about the amount of time that young people spend on social media.\"\n\nThe findings of the study were published in the journal PLOS ONE.\n\nIn other news, a new study has found that people who use social media are more likely to be lonely and depressed.

            "Thanks for joining our live coverage on an extraordinary day in court, with adult-film star Stormy Daniels taking the stand.\n\nIt was a tense courtroom, with Daniels warned to dial back her comments at times. Prosecutors were also told to limit their questions regarding the salacious details of her alleged sexual encounter with Trump (which Trump has denied ever taking place).\n\nHere's our full wrap of what happened in court today.\n\nThis page was edited by Tiffany Wertheimer, Lisa Lambert, Brandon Livesay and Phil McCausland. The writers were Sam Hancock and Sean Seddon, and we had Madeline Halpert and Kayla Epstein in court.\n\nCourt doesn't sit on Wednesday, so we'll be back on Thursday, when Stormy Daniels will once again take to the stand to continue her testimony.\n\nStay tuned for more updates from the courtroom!\n\nIn other news, a new study has found that people who use social media are more likely to be lonely and depressed.
