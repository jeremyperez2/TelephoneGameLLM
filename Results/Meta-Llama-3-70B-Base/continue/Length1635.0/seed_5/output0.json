Her testimony was interrupted by the court on Wednesday, as the judge ruled that she had violated the gag order imposed on her by the president's legal team.\n\nThe order had been imposed after Daniels violated the terms of a $130,000 hush agreement she signed in 2016 to keep quiet about an alleged affair she had with Trump in 2006. The agreement was brokered by Trump's longtime lawyer Michael Cohen, who has since been sentenced to three years in prison for campaign finance violations related to the payment.\n\nIn court on Thursday, Daniels is expected to continue her testimony about the alleged affair, which Trump has denied ever took place. Prosecutors are also expected to question her about her knowledge of Cohen's payments to other women who have made similar allegations against the president.\n\nDaniels has already testified that she had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006, and that she was paid $130,000 by Cohen to keep quiet about it. She has also said that she was threatened with physical violence if she spoke out about the encounter.\n\nThe trial is expected to last several more days, and it is not clear when the jury will begin deliberations. If convicted, Daniels could face up to three years in prison."
