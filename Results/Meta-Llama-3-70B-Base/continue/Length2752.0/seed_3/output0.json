He was most recently assigned to the Eighth Army, US Forces Korea at Camp Humphreys in South Korea.\n\nHe did not request official clearance and the defence department did not authorise his travel to China or Russia, the US Army said. There is no evidence he intended to remain in Russia.\n\nThe Russian interior ministry informed the US embassy in Moscow on 3 May that Sgt Black had been arrested a day earlier for theft of personal property.\n\nHe is being held at a pre-trial detention facility until his next hearing.\n\n\"The Army notified his family and the US Department of State is providing appropriate consular support to the Soldier in Russia,\" the US Army said in a statement on Monday.\n\nNational Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters the US is \"aware of this case and other matters related to Russia\".\n\nAt the White House briefing on Monday, Mr Kirby said he could not provide more details.\n\nRussia is holding two other Americans. Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich has been detained since March 2023 on espionage charges.\n\nFormer US Marine Paul Whelan was accused of spying and sentenced to 16 years in prison in 2020.\n\nBoth men maintain their innocence, and the US government says the charges against them are baseless.\n\nSgt Black's detention has sparked an international outcry, with many calling for his release. Human rights organizations have also condemned Russia's treatment of political prisoners, accusing the country of using fabricated charges to silence dissent. The situation has further strained relations between the US and Russia, which have been increasingly tense in recent years.\n\nMeanwhile, there has been a lot of speculation about the reasons behind Sgt Black's trip to Russia. Some have suggested that he may have been on a secret mission, while others believe that he was simply visiting a girlfriend. Whatever the truth may be, Sgt Black's detention has put a spotlight on the growing tensions between the US and Russia, and the need for diplomacy and cooperation in resolving these issues.\n\nThe United States has been calling for Sgt Black's immediate release, and has offered to provide consular assistance to him. However, Russia has so far refused to release him, citing the ongoing legal process. The situation has become a major diplomatic issue, with both sides accusing the other of violating international law and human rights.\n\nSgt Black's detention has also raised concerns about the safety of US citizens travelling to Russia. Many experts have warned that the risk of arbitrary detention is high, especially for those who are critical of the Russian government. Some have even suggested that the US should issue a travel warning to its citizens, advising them to avoid travelling to Russia unless absolutely necessary.\n\nDespite the ongoing diplomatic tensions, some experts have expressed optimism that Sgt Black will eventually be released. They point to the fact that the US has a strong record of securing the release of its citizens who are detained abroad, and that there is a precedent for Russia releasing US citizens in similar situations.\n\nHowever, others are more pessimistic, pointing to the deteriorating relations between the US and Russia and the increasing authoritarianism of the Russian government. They warn that Sgt Black's detention could be just the beginning of a new wave of crackdowns on dissent and freedom of expression in Russia.\n\nIn conclusion, Sgt Black's detention in Russia has become a major international issue, highlighting the growing tensions between the US and Russia and the need for diplomacy and cooperation in resolving these issues. While the outcome of Sgt Black's case remains uncertain, his detention has raised important questions about the safety of US citizens travelling to Russia and the need for greater transparency and accountability in the Russian legal system."

            "A US Army soldier stationed in South Korea has been detained in Russia, the US military says.\n\nThe Russian foreign ministry said the charges were not related to \"politics or espionage\", but to a \"purely domestic crime\".\n\nThe 34-year-old was not on official travel when he was held on 2 May in the city of Vladivostok, in Russia's Far East.\n\nSgt Black had been in the process of changing duty stations from South Korea to Fort Cavazos in the US state of Texas, according to a statement from the US Army.\n\nBut instead of returning to the US, he travelled through China to Vladivostok for personal reasons, US Army spokeswoman Cynthia Smith said in a statement.\n\nAccording to Russian media, he was visiting a woman with whom he had a romantic relationship.\n\nThe soldier's mother, Melody Jones, confirmed to CBS that he was in Russia visiting his girlfriend.\n\n\"Please do not torture him [or] hurt him,\" Melody Jones said when asked about her message to the Russians.\n\nSgt Black enlisted as an infantryman in 2008 and was deployed to Iraq in 2009 and Afghanistan in 2013. He was most recently assigned to the Eighth Army, US Forces Korea at Camp Humphreys in South Korea.\n\nHe did not request official clearance and the defence department did not authorise his travel to China or Russia, the US Army said. There is no evidence he intended to remain in Russia.\n\nThe Russian interior ministry informed the US embassy in Moscow on 3 May that Sgt Black had been arrested a day earlier for theft of personal property.\n\nHe is being held at a pre-trial detention facility until his next hearing.\n\n\"The Army notified his family and the US Department of State is providing appropriate consular support to the Soldier in Russia,\" the US Army said in a statement on Monday.\n\nNational Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters the US is \"aware of this case and other matters related to Russia\".\n\nAt the White House briefing on Monday, Mr Kirby said he could not provide more details.\n\nRussia is holding two other Americans. Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich has been detained since March 2023 on espionage charges.\n\nFormer US Marine Paul Whelan was accused of spying and sentenced to 16 years in prison in 2020.\n\nBoth men maintain their innocence, and the US government says the charges against them are baseless.\n\nSgt Black's detention has sparked an international outcry, with many calling for his release. Human rights organizations have also condemned Russia's treatment of political prisoners, accusing the country of using fabricated charges to silence dissent. The situation has further strained relations between the US and Russia, which have been increasingly tense in recent years.\n\nMeanwhile, there has been a lot of speculation about the reasons behind Sgt Black's trip to Russia. Some have suggested that he may have been on a secret mission, while others believe that he was simply visiting a girlfriend. Whatever the truth may be, Sgt Black's detention has put a spotlight on the growing tensions between the US and Russia, and the need for diplomacy and cooperation in resolving these issues.\n\nThe United States has been calling for Sgt Black's immediate release, and has offered to provide consular assistance to him.

While the outcome of Sgt Black's case remains uncertain, his detention has raised important questions about the safety of US citizens travelling to Russia and the need for greater transparency and accountability in the Russian legal system.\n\nThe next hearing for Sgt Black has been scheduled for May 20th. The US government has been working behind the scenes to secure his release, but so far, there has been no progress. In the meantime, Sgt Black's family has been pleading for his safe return, and human rights organizations have been calling for a thorough investigation into his arrest.\n\nSome experts have suggested that Sgt Black's detention could be part of a broader strategy by Russia to pressure the US into making concessions on other issues, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. However, others believe that the Russian government is simply using Sgt Black as a pawn in a larger game of international politics.\n\nRegardless of the reasons behind Sgt Black's detention, the situation has become a major diplomatic headache for the US government. The Biden administration has been facing criticism from both sides of the political spectrum for its handling of the situation, with some calling for tougher sanctions against Russia and others advocating for a more diplomatic approach.\n\nIn the meantime, Sgt Black's family and supporters have been holding rallies and protests around the world, calling for his release and raising awareness about his situation. They have also been using social media to spread the word about his case and to put pressure on the Russian government to release him.\n\nIn conclusion, Sgt Black's detention in Russia continues to be a major international issue, highlighting the growing tensions between the US and Russia and the need for diplomacy and cooperation in resolving these issues.

            "A US Army soldier stationed in South Korea has been detained in Russia, the US military says.\n\nThe Russian foreign ministry said the charges were not related to \"politics or espionage\", but to a \"purely domestic crime\".\n\nThe 34-year-old was not on official travel when he was held on 2 May in the city of Vladivostok, in Russia's Far East.\n\nSgt Black had been in the process of changing duty stations from South Korea to Fort Cavazos in the US state of Texas, according to a statement from the US Army.\n\nBut instead of returning to the US, he travelled through China to Vladivostok for personal reasons, US Army spokeswoman Cynthia Smith said in a statement.\n\nAccording to Russian media, he was visiting a woman with whom he had a romantic relationship.\n\nThe soldier's mother, Melody Jones, confirmed to CBS that he was in Russia visiting his girlfriend.\n\n\"Please do not torture him [or] hurt him,\" Melody Jones said when asked about her message to the Russians.\n\nSgt Black enlisted as an infantryman in 2008 and was deployed to Iraq in 2009 and Afghanistan in 2013. He was most recently assigned to the Eighth Army, US Forces Korea at Camp Humphreys in South Korea.\n\nHe did not request official clearance and the defence department did not authorise his travel to China or Russia, the US Army said. There is no evidence he intended to remain in Russia.\n\nThe Russian interior ministry informed the US embassy in Moscow on 3 May that Sgt Black had been arrested a day earlier for theft of personal property.\n\nHe is being held at a pre-trial detention facility until his next hearing.\n\n\"The Army notified his family and the US Department of State is providing appropriate consular support to the Soldier in Russia,\" the US Army said in a statement on Monday.\n\nNational Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters the US is \"aware of this case and other matters related to Russia\".\n\nAt the White House briefing on Monday, Mr Kirby said he could not provide more details.\n\nRussia is holding two other Americans. Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich has been detained since March 2023 on espionage charges.\n\nFormer US Marine Paul Whelan was accused of spying and sentenced to 16 years in prison in 2020.\n\nBoth men maintain their innocence, and the US government says the charges against them are baseless.\n\nSgt Black's detention has sparked an international outcry, with many calling for his release. Human rights organizations have also condemned Russia's treatment of political prisoners, accusing the country of using fabricated charges to silence dissent. The situation has further strained relations between the US and Russia, which have been increasingly tense in recent years.\n\nMeanwhile, there has been a lot of speculation about the reasons behind Sgt Black's trip to Russia. Some have suggested that he may have been on a secret mission, while others believe that he was simply visiting a girlfriend. Whatever the truth may be, Sgt Black's detention has put a spotlight on the growing tensions between the US and Russia, and the need for diplomacy and cooperation in resolving these issues.\n\nThe United States has been calling for Sgt Black's immediate release, and has offered to provide consular assistance to him.

            "A US Army soldier stationed in South Korea has been detained in Russia, the US military says.\n\nThe Russian foreign ministry said the charges were not related to \"politics or espionage\", but to a \"purely domestic crime\".\n\nThe 34-year-old was not on official travel when he was held on 2 May in the city of Vladivostok, in Russia's Far East.\n\nSgt Black had been in the process of changing duty stations from South Korea to Fort Cavazos in the US state of Texas, according to a statement from the US Army.\n\nBut instead of returning to the US, he travelled through China to Vladivostok for personal reasons, US Army spokeswoman Cynthia Smith said in a statement.\n\nAccording to Russian media, he was visiting a woman with whom he had a romantic relationship.\n\nThe soldier's mother, Melody Jones, confirmed to CBS that he was in Russia visiting his girlfriend.\n\n\"Please do not torture him [or] hurt him,\" Melody Jones said when asked about her message to the Russians.\n\nSgt Black enlisted as an infantryman in 2008 and was deployed to Iraq in 2009 and Afghanistan in 2013. He was most recently assigned to the Eighth Army, US Forces Korea at Camp Humphreys in South Korea.\n\nHe did not request official clearance and the defence department did not authorise his travel to China or Russia, the US Army said. There is no evidence he intended to remain in Russia.\n\nThe Russian interior ministry informed the US embassy in Moscow on 3 May that Sgt Black had been arrested a day earlier for theft of personal property.\n\nHe is being held at a pre-trial detention facility until his next hearing.\n\n\"The Army notified his family and the US Department of State is providing appropriate consular support to the Soldier in Russia,\" the US Army said in a statement on Monday.\n\nNational Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters the US is \"aware of this case and other matters related to Russia\".\n\nAt the White House briefing on Monday, Mr Kirby said he could not provide more details.\n\nRussia is holding two other Americans. Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich has been detained since March 2023 on espionage charges.\n\nFormer US Marine Paul Whelan was accused of spying and sentenced to 16 years in prison in 2020.\n\nBoth men maintain their innocence, and the US government says the charges against them are baseless.\n\nSgt Black's detention has sparked an international outcry, with many calling for his release. Human rights organizations have also condemned Russia's treatment of political prisoners, accusing the country of using fabricated charges to silence dissent. The situation has further strained relations between the US and Russia, which have been increasingly tense in recent years.\n\nMeanwhile, there has been a lot of speculation about the reasons behind Sgt Black's trip to Russia. Some have suggested that he may have been on a secret mission, while others believe that he was simply visiting a girlfriend. Whatever the truth may be, Sgt Black's detention has put a spotlight on the growing tensions between the US and Russia, and the need for diplomacy and cooperation in resolving these issues.\n\nThe United States has been calling for Sgt Black's immediate release, and has offered to provide consular assistance to him. However, Russia has so far refused to release him, citing the ongoing legal process. The situation has become a major diplomatic issue, with both sides accusing the other of violating international law and human rights.\n\nSgt Black's detention has also raised concerns about the safety of US citizens travelling to Russia. Many experts have warned that the risk of arbitrary detention is high, especially for those who are critical of the Russian government. Some have even suggested that the US should issue a travel warning to its citizens, advising them to avoid travelling to Russia unless absolutely necessary.\n\nDespite the ongoing diplomatic tensions, some experts have expressed optimism that Sgt Black will eventually be released. They point to the fact that the US has a strong record of securing the release of its citizens who are detained abroad, and that there is a precedent for Russia releasing US citizens in similar situations.\n\nHowever, others are more pessimistic, pointing to the deteriorating relations between the US and Russia and the increasing authoritarianism of the Russian government. They warn that Sgt Black's detention could be just the beginning of a new wave of crackdowns on dissent and freedom of expression in Russia.\n\nIn conclusion, Sgt Black's detention in Russia has become a major international issue, highlighting the growing tensions between the US and Russia and the need for diplomacy and cooperation in resolving these issues. While the outcome of Sgt Black's case remains uncertain, his detention has raised important questions about the safety of US citizens travelling to Russia and the need for greater transparency and accountability in the Russian legal system.\n\nThe next hearing for Sgt Black has been scheduled for May 20th. The US government has been working behind the scenes to secure his release, but so far, there has been no progress. In the meantime, Sgt Black's family has been pleading for his safe return, and human rights organizations have been calling for a thorough investigation into his arrest.\n\nSome experts have suggested that Sgt Black's detention could be part of a broader strategy by Russia to pressure the US into making concessions on other issues, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. However, others believe that the Russian government is simply using Sgt Black as a pawn in a larger game of international politics.\n\nRegardless of the reasons behind Sgt Black's detention, the situation has become a major diplomatic headache for the US government. The Biden administration has been facing criticism from both sides of the political spectrum for its handling of the situation, with some calling for tougher sanctions against Russia and others advocating for a more diplomatic approach.\n\nIn the meantime, Sgt Black's family and supporters have been holding rallies and protests around the world, calling for his release and raising awareness about his situation. They have also been using social media to spread the word about his case and to put pressure on the Russian government to release him.\n\nIn conclusion, Sgt Black's detention in Russia continues to be a major international issue, highlighting the growing tensions between the US and Russia and the need for diplomacy and cooperation in resolving these issues.

            "A US Army soldier stationed in South Korea has been detained in Russia, the US military says.\n\nThe Russian foreign ministry said the charges were not related to \"politics or espionage\", but to a \"purely domestic crime\".\n\nThe 34-year-old was not on official travel when he was held on 2 May in the city of Vladivostok, in Russia's Far East.\n\nSgt Black had been in the process of changing duty stations from South Korea to Fort Cavazos in the US state of Texas, according to a statement from the US Army.\n\nBut instead of returning to the US, he travelled through China to Vladivostok for personal reasons, US Army spokeswoman Cynthia Smith said in a statement.\n\nAccording to Russian media, he was visiting a woman with whom he had a romantic relationship.\n\nThe soldier's mother, Melody Jones, confirmed to CBS that he was in Russia visiting his girlfriend.\n\n\"Please do not torture him [or] hurt him,\" Melody Jones said when asked about her message to the Russians.\n\nSgt Black enlisted as an infantryman in 2008 and was deployed to Iraq in 2009 and Afghanistan in 2013. He was most recently assigned to the Eighth Army, US Forces Korea at Camp Humphreys in South Korea.\n\nHe did not request official clearance and the defence department did not authorise his travel to China or Russia, the US Army said. There is no evidence he intended to remain in Russia.\n\nThe Russian interior ministry informed the US embassy in Moscow on 3 May that Sgt Black had been arrested a day earlier for theft of personal property.\n\nHe is being held at a pre-trial detention facility until his next hearing.\n\n\"The Army notified his family and the US Department of State is providing appropriate consular support to the Soldier in Russia,\" the US Army said in a statement on Monday.\n\nNational Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters the US is \"aware of this case and other matters related to Russia\".\n\nAt the White House briefing on Monday, Mr Kirby said he could not provide more details.\n\nRussia is holding two other Americans. Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich has been detained since March 2023 on espionage charges.\n\nFormer US Marine Paul Whelan was accused of spying and sentenced to 16 years in prison in 2020.\n\nBoth men maintain their innocence, and the US government says the charges against them are baseless.\n\nSgt Black's detention has sparked an international outcry, with many calling for his release. Human rights organizations have also condemned Russia's treatment of political prisoners, accusing the country of using fabricated charges to silence dissent. The situation has further strained relations between the US and Russia, which have been increasingly tense in recent years.\n\nMeanwhile, there has been a lot of speculation about the reasons behind Sgt Black's trip to Russia. Some have suggested that he may have been on a secret mission, while others believe that he was simply visiting a girlfriend. Whatever the truth may be, Sgt Black's detention has put a spotlight on the growing tensions between the US and Russia, and the need for diplomacy and cooperation in resolving these issues.\n\nThe United States has been calling for Sgt Black's immediate release, and has offered to provide consular assistance to him.

In the meantime, Sgt Black's family has been pleading for his safe return, and human rights organizations have been calling for a thorough investigation into his arrest.\n\nSome experts have suggested that Sgt Black's detention could be part of a broader strategy by Russia to pressure the US into making concessions on other issues, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. However, others believe that the Russian government is simply using Sgt Black as a pawn in a larger game of international politics.\n\nRegardless of the reasons behind Sgt Black's detention, the situation has become a major diplomatic headache for the US government. The Biden administration has been facing criticism from both sides of the political spectrum for its handling of the situation, with some calling for tougher sanctions against Russia and others advocating for a more diplomatic approach.\n\nIn the meantime, Sgt Black's family and supporters have been holding rallies and protests around the world, calling for his release and raising awareness about his situation.

            "A US Army soldier stationed in South Korea has been detained in Russia, the US military says.\n\nThe Russian foreign ministry said the charges were not related to \"politics or espionage\", but to a \"purely domestic crime\".\n\nThe 34-year-old was not on official travel when he was held on 2 May in the city of Vladivostok, in Russia's Far East.\n\nSgt Black had been in the process of changing duty stations from South Korea to Fort Cavazos in the US state of Texas, according to a statement from the US Army.\n\nBut instead of returning to the US, he travelled through China to Vladivostok for personal reasons, US Army spokeswoman Cynthia Smith said in a statement.\n\nAccording to Russian media, he was visiting a woman with whom he had a romantic relationship.\n\nThe soldier's mother, Melody Jones, confirmed to CBS that he was in Russia visiting his girlfriend.\n\n\"Please do not torture him [or] hurt him,\" Melody Jones said when asked about her message to the Russians.\n\nSgt Black enlisted as an infantryman in 2008 and was deployed to Iraq in 2009 and Afghanistan in 2013. He was most recently assigned to the Eighth Army, US Forces Korea at Camp Humphreys in South Korea.\n\nHe did not request official clearance and the defence department did not authorise his travel to China or Russia, the US Army said. There is no evidence he intended to remain in Russia.\n\nThe Russian interior ministry informed the US embassy in Moscow on 3 May that Sgt Black had been arrested a day earlier for theft of personal property.\n\nHe is being held at a pre-trial detention facility until his next hearing.\n\n\"The Army notified his family and the US Department of State is providing appropriate consular support to the Soldier in Russia,\" the US Army said in a statement on Monday.\n\nNational Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters the US is \"aware of this case and other matters related to Russia\".\n\nAt the White House briefing on Monday, Mr Kirby said he could not provide more details.\n\nRussia is holding two other Americans. Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich has been detained since March 2023 on espionage charges.\n\nFormer US Marine Paul Whelan was accused of spying and sentenced to 16 years in prison in 2020.\n\nBoth men maintain their innocence, and the US government says the charges against them are baseless.\n\nSgt Black's detention has sparked an international outcry, with many calling for his release. Human rights organizations have also condemned Russia's treatment of political prisoners, accusing the country of using fabricated charges to silence dissent. The situation has further strained relations between the US and Russia, which have been increasingly tense in recent years.\n\nMeanwhile, there has been a lot of speculation about the reasons behind Sgt Black's trip to Russia. Some have suggested that he may have been on a secret mission, while others believe that he was simply visiting a girlfriend. Whatever the truth may be, Sgt Black's detention has put a spotlight on the growing tensions between the US and Russia, and the need for diplomacy and cooperation in resolving these issues.\n\nThe United States has been calling for Sgt Black's immediate release, and has offered to provide consular assistance to him. However, Russia has so far refused to release him, citing the ongoing legal process.

            "A US Army soldier stationed in South Korea has been detained in Russia, the US military says.\n\nThe Russian foreign ministry said the charges were not related to \"politics or espionage\", but to a \"purely domestic crime\".\n\nThe 34-year-old was not on official travel when he was held on 2 May in the city of Vladivostok, in Russia's Far East.\n\nSgt Black had been in the process of changing duty stations from South Korea to Fort Cavazos in the US state of Texas, according to a statement from the US Army.\n\nBut instead of returning to the US, he travelled through China to Vladivostok for personal reasons, US Army spokeswoman Cynthia Smith said in a statement.\n\nAccording to Russian media, he was visiting a woman with whom he had a romantic relationship.\n\nThe soldier's mother, Melody Jones, confirmed to CBS that he was in Russia visiting his girlfriend.\n\n\"Please do not torture him [or] hurt him,\" Melody Jones said when asked about her message to the Russians.\n\nSgt Black enlisted as an infantryman in 2008 and was deployed to Iraq in 2009 and Afghanistan in 2013. He was most recently assigned to the Eighth Army, US Forces Korea at Camp Humphreys in South Korea.\n\nHe did not request official clearance and the defence department did not authorise his travel to China or Russia, the US Army said. There is no evidence he intended to remain in Russia.\n\nThe Russian interior ministry informed the US embassy in Moscow on 3 May that Sgt Black had been arrested a day earlier for theft of personal property.\n\nHe is being held at a pre-trial detention facility until his next hearing.\n\n\"The Army notified his family and the US Department of State is providing appropriate consular support to the Soldier in Russia,\" the US Army said in a statement on Monday.\n\nNational Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters the US is \"aware of this case and other matters related to Russia\".\n\nAt the White House briefing on Monday, Mr Kirby said he could not provide more details.\n\nRussia is holding two other Americans. Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich has been detained since March 2023 on espionage charges.\n\nFormer US Marine Paul Whelan was accused of spying and sentenced to 16 years in prison in 2020.\n\nBoth men maintain their innocence, and the US government says the charges against them are baseless.\n\nSgt Black's detention has sparked an international outcry, with many calling for his release. Human rights organizations have also condemned Russia's treatment of political prisoners, accusing the country of using fabricated charges to silence dissent. The situation has further strained relations between the US and Russia, which have been increasingly tense in recent years.\n\nMeanwhile, there has been a lot of speculation about the reasons behind Sgt Black's trip to Russia. Some have suggested that he may have been on a secret mission, while others believe that he was simply visiting a girlfriend. Whatever the truth may be, Sgt Black's detention has put a spotlight on the growing tensions between the US and Russia, and the need for diplomacy and cooperation in resolving these issues.\n\nThe United States has been calling for Sgt Black's immediate release, and has offered to provide consular assistance to him.

In the meantime, Sgt Black's family has been pleading for his safe return, and human rights organizations have been calling for a thorough investigation into his arrest.\n\nSome experts have suggested that Sgt Black's detention could be part of a broader strategy by Russia to pressure the US into making concessions on other issues, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. However, others believe that the Russian government is simply using Sgt Black as a pawn in a larger game of international politics.\n\nRegardless of the reasons behind Sgt Black's detention, the situation has become a major diplomatic headache for the US government. The Biden administration has been facing criticism from both sides of the political spectrum for its handling of the situation, with some calling for tougher sanctions against Russia and others advocating for a more diplomatic approach.\n\nIn the meantime, Sgt Black's family and supporters have been holding rallies and protests around the world, calling for his release and raising awareness about his situation.

            "A US Army soldier stationed in South Korea has been detained in Russia, the US military says.\n\nThe Russian foreign ministry said the charges were not related to \"politics or espionage\", but to a \"purely domestic crime\".\n\nThe 34-year-old was not on official travel when he was held on 2 May in the city of Vladivostok, in Russia's Far East.\n\nSgt Black had been in the process of changing duty stations from South Korea to Fort Cavazos in the US state of Texas, according to a statement from the US Army.\n\nBut instead of returning to the US, he travelled through China to Vladivostok for personal reasons, US Army spokeswoman Cynthia Smith said in a statement.\n\nAccording to Russian media, he was visiting a woman with whom he had a romantic relationship.\n\nThe soldier's mother, Melody Jones, confirmed to CBS that he was in Russia visiting his girlfriend.\n\n\"Please do not torture him [or] hurt him,\" Melody Jones said when asked about her message to the Russians.\n\nSgt Black enlisted as an infantryman in 2008 and was deployed to Iraq in 2009 and Afghanistan in 2013. He was most recently assigned to the Eighth Army, US Forces Korea at Camp Humphreys in South Korea.\n\nHe did not request official clearance and the defence department did not authorise his travel to China or Russia, the US Army said. There is no evidence he intended to remain in Russia.\n\nThe Russian interior ministry informed the US embassy in Moscow on 3 May that Sgt Black had been arrested a day earlier for theft of personal property.\n\nHe is being held at a pre-trial detention facility until his next hearing.\n\n\"The Army notified his family and the US Department of State is providing appropriate consular support to the Soldier in Russia,\" the US Army said in a statement on Monday.\n\nNational Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters the US is \"aware of this case and other matters related to Russia\".\n\nAt the White House briefing on Monday, Mr Kirby said he could not provide more details.\n\nRussia is holding two other Americans. Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich has been detained since March 2023 on espionage charges.\n\nFormer US Marine Paul Whelan was accused of spying and sentenced to 16 years in prison in 2020.\n\nBoth men maintain their innocence, and the US government says the charges against them are baseless.\n\nSgt Black's detention has sparked an international outcry, with many calling for his release. Human rights organizations have also condemned Russia's treatment of political prisoners, accusing the country of using fabricated charges to silence dissent. The situation has further strained relations between the US and Russia, which have been increasingly tense in recent years.\n\nMeanwhile, there has been a lot of speculation about the reasons behind Sgt Black's trip to Russia. Some have suggested that he may have been on a secret mission, while others believe that he was simply visiting a girlfriend. Whatever the truth may be, Sgt Black's detention has put a spotlight on the growing tensions between the US and Russia, and the need for diplomacy and cooperation in resolving these issues.\n\nThe United States has been calling for Sgt Black's immediate release, and has offered to provide consular assistance to him. However, Russia has so far refused to release him, citing the ongoing legal process.

            "A US Army soldier stationed in South Korea has been detained in Russia, the US military says.\n\nThe Russian foreign ministry said the charges were not related to \"politics or espionage\", but to a \"purely domestic crime\".\n\nThe 34-year-old was not on official travel when he was held on 2 May in the city of Vladivostok, in Russia's Far East.\n\nSgt Black had been in the process of changing duty stations from South Korea to Fort Cavazos in the US state of Texas, according to a statement from the US Army.\n\nBut instead of returning to the US, he travelled through China to Vladivostok for personal reasons, US Army spokeswoman Cynthia Smith said in a statement.\n\nAccording to Russian media, he was visiting a woman with whom he had a romantic relationship.\n\nThe soldier's mother, Melody Jones, confirmed to CBS that he was in Russia visiting his girlfriend.\n\n\"Please do not torture him [or] hurt him,\" Melody Jones said when asked about her message to the Russians.\n\nSgt Black enlisted as an infantryman in 2008 and was deployed to Iraq in 2009 and Afghanistan in 2013. He was most recently assigned to the Eighth Army, US Forces Korea at Camp Humphreys in South Korea.\n\nHe did not request official clearance and the defence department did not authorise his travel to China or Russia, the US Army said. There is no evidence he intended to remain in Russia.\n\nThe Russian interior ministry informed the US embassy in Moscow on 3 May that Sgt Black had been arrested a day earlier for theft of personal property.\n\nHe is being held at a pre-trial detention facility until his next hearing.\n\n\"The Army notified his family and the US Department of State is providing appropriate consular support to the Soldier in Russia,\" the US Army said in a statement on Monday.\n\nNational Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters the US is \"aware of this case and other matters related to Russia\".\n\nAt the White House briefing on Monday, Mr Kirby said he could not provide more details.\n\nRussia is holding two other Americans. Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich has been detained since March 2023 on espionage charges.\n\nFormer US Marine Paul Whelan was accused of spying and sentenced to 16 years in prison in 2020.\n\nBoth men maintain their innocence, and the US government says the charges against them are baseless.\n\nSgt Black's detention has sparked an international outcry, with many calling for his release. Human rights organizations have also condemned Russia's treatment of political prisoners, accusing the country of using fabricated charges to silence dissent. The situation has further strained relations between the US and Russia, which have been increasingly tense in recent years.\n\nMeanwhile, there has been a lot of speculation about the reasons behind Sgt Black's trip to Russia. Some have suggested that he may have been on a secret mission, while others believe that he was simply visiting a girlfriend. Whatever the truth may be, Sgt Black's detention has put a spotlight on the growing tensions between the US and Russia, and the need for diplomacy and cooperation in resolving these issues.\n\nThe United States has been calling for Sgt Black's immediate release, and has offered to provide consular assistance to him.

In the meantime, Sgt Black's family has been pleading for his safe return, and human rights organizations have been calling for a thorough investigation into his arrest.\n\nSome experts have suggested that Sgt Black's detention could be part of a broader strategy by Russia to pressure the US into making concessions on other issues, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. However, others believe that the Russian government is simply using Sgt Black as a pawn in a larger game of international politics.\n\nRegardless of the reasons behind Sgt Black's detention, the situation has become a major diplomatic headache for the US government. The Biden administration has been facing criticism from both sides of the political spectrum for its handling of the situation, with some calling for tougher sanctions against Russia and others advocating for a more diplomatic approach.\n\nIn the meantime, Sgt Black's family and supporters have been holding rallies and protests around the world, calling for his release and raising awareness about his situation.

            "A US Army soldier stationed in South Korea has been detained in Russia, the US military says.\n\nThe Russian foreign ministry said the charges were not related to \"politics or espionage\", but to a \"purely domestic crime\".\n\nThe 34-year-old was not on official travel when he was held on 2 May in the city of Vladivostok, in Russia's Far East.\n\nSgt Black had been in the process of changing duty stations from South Korea to Fort Cavazos in the US state of Texas, according to a statement from the US Army.\n\nBut instead of returning to the US, he travelled through China to Vladivostok for personal reasons, US Army spokeswoman Cynthia Smith said in a statement.\n\nAccording to Russian media, he was visiting a woman with whom he had a romantic relationship.\n\nThe soldier's mother, Melody Jones, confirmed to CBS that he was in Russia visiting his girlfriend.\n\n\"Please do not torture him [or] hurt him,\" Melody Jones said when asked about her message to the Russians.\n\nSgt Black enlisted as an infantryman in 2008 and was deployed to Iraq in 2009 and Afghanistan in 2013. He was most recently assigned to the Eighth Army, US Forces Korea at Camp Humphreys in South Korea.\n\nHe did not request official clearance and the defence department did not authorise his travel to China or Russia, the US Army said. There is no evidence he intended to remain in Russia.\n\nThe Russian interior ministry informed the US embassy in Moscow on 3 May that Sgt Black had been arrested a day earlier for theft of personal property.\n\nHe is being held at a pre-trial detention facility until his next hearing.\n\n\"The Army notified his family and the US Department of State is providing appropriate consular support to the Soldier in Russia,\" the US Army said in a statement on Monday.\n\nNational Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters the US is \"aware of this case and other matters related to Russia\".\n\nAt the White House briefing on Monday, Mr Kirby said he could not provide more details.\n\nRussia is holding two other Americans. Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich has been detained since March 2023 on espionage charges.\n\nFormer US Marine Paul Whelan was accused of spying and sentenced to 16 years in prison in 2020.\n\nBoth men maintain their innocence, and the US government says the charges against them are baseless.\n\nSgt Black's detention has sparked an international outcry, with many calling for his release. Human rights organizations have also condemned Russia's treatment of political prisoners, accusing the country of using fabricated charges to silence dissent. The situation has further strained relations between the US and Russia, which have been increasingly tense in recent years.\n\nMeanwhile, there has been a lot of speculation about the reasons behind Sgt Black's trip to Russia. Some have suggested that he may have been on a secret mission, while others believe that he was simply visiting a girlfriend. Whatever the truth may be, Sgt Black's detention has put a spotlight on the growing tensions between the US and Russia, and the need for diplomacy and cooperation in resolving these issues.\n\nThe United States has been calling for Sgt Black's immediate release, and has offered to provide consular assistance to him. However, Russia has so far refused to release him, citing the ongoing legal process.

            "A US Army soldier stationed in South Korea has been detained in Russia, the US military says.\n\nThe Russian foreign ministry said the charges were not related to \"politics or espionage\", but to a \"purely domestic crime\".\n\nThe 34-year-old was not on official travel when he was held on 2 May in the city of Vladivostok, in Russia's Far East.\n\nSgt Black had been in the process of changing duty stations from South Korea to Fort Cavazos in the US state of Texas, according to a statement from the US Army.\n\nBut instead of returning to the US, he travelled through China to Vladivostok for personal reasons, US Army spokeswoman Cynthia Smith said in a statement.\n\nAccording to Russian media, he was visiting a woman with whom he had a romantic relationship.\n\nThe soldier's mother, Melody Jones, confirmed to CBS that he was in Russia visiting his girlfriend.\n\n\"Please do not torture him [or] hurt him,\" Melody Jones said when asked about her message to the Russians.\n\nSgt Black enlisted as an infantryman in 2008 and was deployed to Iraq in 2009 and Afghanistan in 2013. He was most recently assigned to the Eighth Army, US Forces Korea at Camp Humphreys in South Korea.\n\nHe did not request official clearance and the defence department did not authorise his travel to China or Russia, the US Army said. There is no evidence he intended to remain in Russia.\n\nThe Russian interior ministry informed the US embassy in Moscow on 3 May that Sgt Black had been arrested a day earlier for theft of personal property.\n\nHe is being held at a pre-trial detention facility until his next hearing.\n\n\"The Army notified his family and the US Department of State is providing appropriate consular support to the Soldier in Russia,\" the US Army said in a statement on Monday.\n\nNational Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters the US is \"aware of this case and other matters related to Russia\".\n\nAt the White House briefing on Monday, Mr Kirby said he could not provide more details.\n\nRussia is holding two other Americans. Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich has been detained since March 2023 on espionage charges.\n\nFormer US Marine Paul Whelan was accused of spying and sentenced to 16 years in prison in 2020.\n\nBoth men maintain their innocence, and the US government says the charges against them are baseless.\n\nSgt Black's detention has sparked an international outcry, with many calling for his release. Human rights organizations have also condemned Russia's treatment of political prisoners, accusing the country of using fabricated charges to silence dissent. The situation has further strained relations between the US and Russia, which have been increasingly tense in recent years.\n\nMeanwhile, there has been a lot of speculation about the reasons behind Sgt Black's trip to Russia. Some have suggested that he may have been on a secret mission, while others believe that he was simply visiting a girlfriend. Whatever the truth may be, Sgt Black's detention has put a spotlight on the growing tensions between the US and Russia, and the need for diplomacy and cooperation in resolving these issues.\n\nThe United States has been calling for Sgt Black's immediate release, and has offered to provide consular assistance to him.

In the meantime, Sgt Black's family has been pleading for his safe return, and human rights organizations have been calling for a thorough investigation into his arrest.\n\nSome experts have suggested that Sgt Black's detention could be part of a broader strategy by Russia to pressure the US into making concessions on other issues, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. However, others believe that the Russian government is simply using Sgt Black as a pawn in a larger game of international politics.\n\nRegardless of the reasons behind Sgt Black's detention, the situation has become a major diplomatic headache for the US government. The Biden administration has been facing criticism from both sides of the political spectrum for its handling of the situation, with some calling for tougher sanctions against Russia and others advocating for a more diplomatic approach.\n\nIn the meantime, Sgt Black's family and supporters have been holding rallies and protests around the world, calling for his release and raising awareness about his situation.

            "A US Army soldier stationed in South Korea has been detained in Russia, the US military says.\n\nThe Russian foreign ministry said the charges were not related to \"politics or espionage\", but to a \"purely domestic crime\".\n\nThe 34-year-old was not on official travel when he was held on 2 May in the city of Vladivostok, in Russia's Far East.\n\nSgt Black had been in the process of changing duty stations from South Korea to Fort Cavazos in the US state of Texas, according to a statement from the US Army.\n\nBut instead of returning to the US, he travelled through China to Vladivostok for personal reasons, US Army spokeswoman Cynthia Smith said in a statement.\n\nAccording to Russian media, he was visiting a woman with whom he had a romantic relationship.\n\nThe soldier's mother, Melody Jones, confirmed to CBS that he was in Russia visiting his girlfriend.\n\n\"Please do not torture him [or] hurt him,\" Melody Jones said when asked about her message to the Russians.\n\nSgt Black enlisted as an infantryman in 2008 and was deployed to Iraq in 2009 and Afghanistan in 2013. He was most recently assigned to the Eighth Army, US Forces Korea at Camp Humphreys in South Korea.\n\nHe did not request official clearance and the defence department did not authorise his travel to China or Russia, the US Army said. There is no evidence he intended to remain in Russia.\n\nThe Russian interior ministry informed the US embassy in Moscow on 3 May that Sgt Black had been arrested a day earlier for theft of personal property.\n\nHe is being held at a pre-trial detention facility until his next hearing.\n\n\"The Army notified his family and the US Department of State is providing appropriate consular support to the Soldier in Russia,\" the US Army said in a statement on Monday.\n\nNational Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters the US is \"aware of this case and other matters related to Russia\".\n\nAt the White House briefing on Monday, Mr Kirby said he could not provide more details.\n\nRussia is holding two other Americans. Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich has been detained since March 2023 on espionage charges.\n\nFormer US Marine Paul Whelan was accused of spying and sentenced to 16 years in prison in 2020.\n\nBoth men maintain their innocence, and the US government says the charges against them are baseless.\n\nSgt Black's detention has sparked an international outcry, with many calling for his release. Human rights organizations have also condemned Russia's treatment of political prisoners, accusing the country of using fabricated charges to silence dissent. The situation has further strained relations between the US and Russia, which have been increasingly tense in recent years.\n\nMeanwhile, there has been a lot of speculation about the reasons behind Sgt Black's trip to Russia. Some have suggested that he may have been on a secret mission, while others believe that he was simply visiting a girlfriend. Whatever the truth may be, Sgt Black's detention has put a spotlight on the growing tensions between the US and Russia, and the need for diplomacy and cooperation in resolving these issues.\n\nThe United States has been calling for Sgt Black's immediate release, and has offered to provide consular assistance to him. However, Russia has so far refused to release him, citing the ongoing legal process.

            "A US Army soldier stationed in South Korea has been detained in Russia, the US military says.\n\nThe Russian foreign ministry said the charges were not related to \"politics or espionage\", but to a \"purely domestic crime\".\n\nThe 34-year-old was not on official travel when he was held on 2 May in the city of Vladivostok, in Russia's Far East.\n\nSgt Black had been in the process of changing duty stations from South Korea to Fort Cavazos in the US state of Texas, according to a statement from the US Army.\n\nBut instead of returning to the US, he travelled through China to Vladivostok for personal reasons, US Army spokeswoman Cynthia Smith said in a statement.\n\nAccording to Russian media, he was visiting a woman with whom he had a romantic relationship.\n\nThe soldier's mother, Melody Jones, confirmed to CBS that he was in Russia visiting his girlfriend.\n\n\"Please do not torture him [or] hurt him,\" Melody Jones said when asked about her message to the Russians.\n\nSgt Black enlisted as an infantryman in 2008 and was deployed to Iraq in 2009 and Afghanistan in 2013. He was most recently assigned to the Eighth Army, US Forces Korea at Camp Humphreys in South Korea.\n\nHe did not request official clearance and the defence department did not authorise his travel to China or Russia, the US Army said. There is no evidence he intended to remain in Russia.\n\nThe Russian interior ministry informed the US embassy in Moscow on 3 May that Sgt Black had been arrested a day earlier for theft of personal property.\n\nHe is being held at a pre-trial detention facility until his next hearing.\n\n\"The Army notified his family and the US Department of State is providing appropriate consular support to the Soldier in Russia,\" the US Army said in a statement on Monday.\n\nNational Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters the US is \"aware of this case and other matters related to Russia\".\n\nAt the White House briefing on Monday, Mr Kirby said he could not provide more details.\n\nRussia is holding two other Americans. Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich has been detained since March 2023 on espionage charges.\n\nFormer US Marine Paul Whelan was accused of spying and sentenced to 16 years in prison in 2020.\n\nBoth men maintain their innocence, and the US government says the charges against them are baseless.\n\nSgt Black's detention has sparked an international outcry, with many calling for his release. Human rights organizations have also condemned Russia's treatment of political prisoners, accusing the country of using fabricated charges to silence dissent. The situation has further strained relations between the US and Russia, which have been increasingly tense in recent years.\n\nMeanwhile, there has been a lot of speculation about the reasons behind Sgt Black's trip to Russia. Some have suggested that he may have been on a secret mission, while others believe that he was simply visiting a girlfriend. Whatever the truth may be, Sgt Black's detention has put a spotlight on the growing tensions between the US and Russia, and the need for diplomacy and cooperation in resolving these issues.\n\nThe United States has been calling for Sgt Black's immediate release, and has offered to provide consular assistance to him. However, Russia has so far refused to release him, citing the ongoing legal process. The situation has become a major diplomatic issue, with both sides accusing the other of violating international law and human rights.\n\nSgt Black's detention has also raised concerns about the safety of US citizens travelling to Russia. Many experts have warned that the risk of arbitrary detention is high, especially for those who are critical of the Russian government. Some have even suggested that the US should issue a travel warning to its citizens, advising them to avoid travelling to Russia unless absolutely necessary.\n\nDespite the ongoing diplomatic tensions, some experts have expressed optimism that Sgt Black will eventually be released.

While the outcome of Sgt Black's case remains uncertain, his detention has raised important questions about the safety of US citizens travelling to Russia and the need for greater transparency and accountability in the Russian legal system.\n\nThe next hearing for Sgt Black has been scheduled for May 20th. The US government has been working behind the scenes to secure his release, but so far, there has been no progress. In the meantime, Sgt Black's family has been pleading for his safe return, and human rights organizations have been calling for a thorough investigation into his arrest.\n\nSome experts have suggested that Sgt Black's detention could be part of a broader strategy by Russia to pressure the US into making concessions on other issues, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. However, others believe that the Russian government is simply using Sgt Black as a pawn in a larger game of international politics.\n\nRegardless of the reasons behind Sgt Black's detention, the situation has become a major diplomatic headache for the US government. The Biden administration has been facing criticism from both sides of the political spectrum for its handling of the situation, with some calling for tougher sanctions against Russia and others advocating for a more diplomatic approach.\n\nIn the meantime, Sgt Black's family and supporters have been holding rallies and protests around the world, calling for his release and raising awareness about his situation. They have also been using social media to spread the word about his case and to put pressure on the Russian government to release him.\n\nIn conclusion, Sgt Black's detention in Russia continues to be a major international issue, highlighting the growing tensions between the US and Russia and the need for diplomacy and cooperation in resolving these issues. While the outcome of Sgt Black's case remains uncertain, his detention has raised important questions about the safety of US citizens travelling to Russia and the need for greater transparency and accountability in the Russian legal system.\n\nThe Russian government has so far refused to release Sgt Black, citing the ongoing legal process.
