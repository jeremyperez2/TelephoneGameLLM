Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich has been detained since March 2023 on espionage charges.\n\nFormer US Marine Paul Whelan was accused of spying and sentenced to 16 years in prison in 2020.\n\nBoth men maintain their innocence, and the US government says the charges against them are baseless.\n\nAfter months of negotiations between Washington and Moscow, US officials announced on Wednesday that they had secured the release of Sgt Black from Russian custody.\n\nThe deal was brokered by President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin during their meeting in Geneva last week, according to a senior administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.\n\nBiden administration officials said the agreement included a promise by Russia not to prosecute Sgt Black further or seek his extradition.\n\nIn exchange, the United States agreed to provide medical treatment to a Russian citizen who is being held in a U.S. prison on unrelated charges.\n\nSergeant Black returned home to Texas earlier this week after spending nearly five months in Russian detention. His family members welcomed him back with open arms.\n\n\"I'm just so happy he's safe and sound,\" his mother, Melody Jones, told CBS News. \"It's like a miracle.\"\n\nSergeant Black has declined to speak publicly about his time in Russia, but his lawyer, Mark Zaid, described the ordeal as \"a nightmare.\"\n\n\"He was kept in solitary confinement for weeks on end, and he was never given any legal representation,\" Zaid said. \"The only time he saw a lawyer was when he met with us.\"\n\nZaid added that Sergeant Black suffered from serious health problems while in custody, including pneumonia and dehydration.\n\nDespite the hardships he endured, Sergeant Black remains committed to serving his country, his lawyer said.\n\n\"He wants people to know that he loves the United States Army and that he is proud to have served his nation,\" Zaid said.\n\nAs for Gershkovich and Whelan, the Biden administration continues to push for their release as well.\n\n\"We will never stop fighting for them,\" a State Department spokesperson said in a statement. \"We call on Russia to immediately and unconditionally release these innocent Americans.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Whelan's family members are also celebrating the news of Sgt Black's release.\n\n\"We're overjoyed that Sgt Black is finally free,\" Whelan's brother, David, said in a statement. \"But our joy is tempered by the fact that Evan Gershkovich and Paul remain behind bars.\"\n\nWhelan's family members are urging the Biden administration to do everything possible to secure their loved one's freedom.\n\n\"We ask that the administration continue to prioritize our brother's case and work tirelessly to bring him home,\" they said.\n\nThe release of Sgt Black comes amid heightened tensions between Washington and Moscow over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nWhile the two countries have made some progress on certain issues, such as prisoner exchanges, they remain deeply divided on many others, including sanctions and military assistance to Kyiv.\n\nStill, the resolution of Sgt Black's case provides a glimmer of hope for those who believe that diplomacy can still prevail even in the darkest of times.\n\n\"The fact that we were able to get Sgt Black back shows that we can make deals with Russia even in times of conflict,\" a senior Biden administration official said. \"That gives us reason to be optimistic about the future.\""
