            "What the hell is going on that we are struggling with these facilities that take care of the mentally challenged or health care for Alzheimer's patients that have other medical issues? St. Mary's in Grand Junction just discharged a friend who broke a hip and has Alzheimer's without rehab for the hip and no place with beds open for Alzheimer's! Ludicrous! The \"authorities\" closed the facility to accommodate \"challenged\" residents here last year and re-located them to Denver. Again, ridiculous! Our health care system is without compassion and based on the bottom line! The worst part is drug addicts, emergency room managers of all sorts can get care but we treat those who have health issues as seniors like shit! Sad state of affairs! Shame on healthcare and those who do not fight for dignity in end of life care! Shameful! Politicians should be shamed for not supporting a bill that cares for these people!\n\nWhat are you going to do about it? You can't just sit back and let this happen. It's not fair to those who need help. We need to take action and make sure that these people get the care they need. There's no reason why they should be treated like second-class citizens just because they have a mental illness or Alzheimer's disease. It's time we stand up for them and demand change.\n\nWe need to fight for change and demand that our politicians support a bill that cares for these people.

            "The worst part is drug addicts, emergency room managers of all sorts can get care but we treat those who have health issues as seniors like shit! Sad state of affairs! Shame on healthcare and those who do not fight for dignity in end of life care! Shameful! Politicians should be shamed for not supporting a bill that cares for these people!\n\nWhat are you going to do about it? You can't just sit back and let this happen. It's not fair to those who need help. We need to take action and make sure that these people get the care they need. There's no reason why they should be treated like second-class citizens just because they have a mental illness or Alzheimer's disease.
