Our health care system is without compassion and based on the bottom line! The worst part is drug addicts, emergency room managers of all sorts can get care but we treat those who have health issues as seniors like shit! Sad state of affairs! Shame on healthcare and those who do not fight for dignity in end of life care! Shameful! Politicians should be shamed for not supporting a bill that cares for these people!\n\nIn a similar vein, many politicians are being criticized for their lack of support for policies that would help the elderly and those with mental health issues. Many argue that these politicians are more concerned with their own personal interests than with the needs of their constituents. This is a sad state of affairs, and it is time for these politicians to be held accountable for their actions.\n\nThere are many organizations that are working to support those with mental health issues and the elderly. These organizations are doing important work, and they need our support.

Many argue that these politicians are more concerned with their own personal interests than with the needs of their constituents. This is a sad state of affairs, and it is time for these politicians to be held accountable for their actions.\n\nWhat the hell is going on that we are struggling with these facilities that take care of the mentally challenged or health care for Alzheimer's patients that have other medical issues? St. Mary's in Grand Junction just discharged a friend who broke a hip and has Alzheimer's without rehab for the hip and no place with beds open for Alzheimer's! Ludicrous! The \"authorities\" closed the facility to accommodate \"challenged \" residents here last year and re-located them to Denver. Again, ridiculous! Our health care system is without compassion and based on the bottom line! The worst part is drug addicts, emergency room managers of all sorts can get care but we treat those who have health issues as seniors like shit! Sad state of affairs! Shame on healthcare and those who do not fight for dignity in end of life care! Shameful! Politicians should be shamed for not supporting a bill that cares for these people!\n\nI believe that we can all agree that it is time to come together and demand better from our politicians. We must hold them accountable for their actions and ensure that they are working for the benefit of all of their constituents. Only then can we hope to make progress on the important issues facing our society.\n\nThere are many organizations that are working to support those with mental health issues and the elderly. These organizations are doing important work, and they need our support. We should all do our part to help these organizations so that they can continue to provide vital services to those who need them most.\n\nIn a similar vein, many politicians are being criticized for their lack of support for policies that would help the elderly and those with mental health issues.
