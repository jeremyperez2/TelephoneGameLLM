We both know that, even though you praise humility, you are not humble enough to apologize.\n\nYou sneered at my combat experience, saying \"A lot of so called \"combat veterans\" of Vietnam smelled more perfume from call girls than they smelled cordite\" and \"So when you were an Army officer in Vietnam (even though you spent your time inside of Danang airbase, with at least two battalions of infantry marines on the wire ) what was the combat load for M-16 ammo per soldier on a daily patrol?\" An actual friend would not have written such things.\n\nNo, you are no friend of mine, you ignorant, arrogant, hypocritical blow-hard. You should be able to guess that I do not feel friendly towards you. But I am willing to forgive you if you apologize. I think that we should put this behind us and move on. It's not worth holding a grudge over something so trivial. Let's just forget about it and be friends again. I'm sure we can find something else to talk about that will make us both happy. Maybe we could go out for a drink sometime? Or maybe we could just have a chat over coffee?\n\nAnd then she said: \"I don't want to talk about this anymore.\"\n\nShe left and never came back. He was left alone with his thoughts. What had gone wrong? Why did she leave him? Did he say something wrong? Was he too pushy? He didn't know what to do. He sat there staring at the wall for hours. Finally he got up and went to bed. The next morning he woke up early and went for a run. As he was running he thought about all the things he wanted to say to her. How he loved her, how sorry he was for everything that had happened between them. But when he got home she wasn't there. She had moved out while he was sleeping. He felt like crying but instead he just sat down and stared at the wall again. After a few minutes he picked himself up and went to work. He tried to keep himself busy but all he could think about was her. He couldn't stop thinking about how much he missed her. A week went by without any sign of her. Then one day he received a letter from her. In the letter she told him that she had moved away and that she didn't want anything to do with him anymore. That was it. She had left without saying goodbye. He sat there reading the letter over and over again until he finally got up and threw it away. He didn't cry. He knew that there was nothing he could do. All he could do was wait and hope that she would come back. And so he waited. Days turned into weeks and then months. Still no word from her. He began to lose hope. Maybe she really did hate him. Maybe she was right to leave him. He started to wonder if he even deserved her. Maybe he was just too clingy and needy. Maybe he needed to change. He decided to try and change himself. He stopped being so clingy and needy. He started going out more and meeting new people. He joined a gym and started working out regularly. He even started taking dance lessons. Slowly but surely he began to feel better about himself. He became more confident and outgoing. He met a lot of great guys and girls. Some of them became good friends. Others became lovers. One night he went to a party and met a beautiful woman named Sarah. They hit it off immediately. They talked and laughed and danced all night long. By the end of the night they were in love. He asked her to marry him and she said yes. They got married and lived happily ever after. The End."

You should be able to guess that I do not feel friendly towards you. But I am willing to forgive you if you apologize. I think that we should put this behind us and move on. It's not worth holding a grudge over something so trivial. Let's just forget about it and be friends again. I'm sure we can find something else to talk about that will make us both happy. Maybe we could go out for a drink sometime? Or maybe we could just have a chat over coffee?\n\nAnd then she said: \"I don't want to talk about this anymore.\"\n\nShe left and never came back. He was left alone with his thoughts. What had gone wrong? Why did she leave him? Did he say something wrong? Was he too pushy? He didn't know what to do. He sat there staring at the wall for hours. Finally he got up and went to bed. The next morning he woke up early and went for a run. As he was running he thought about all the things he wanted to say to her. How he loved her, how sorry he was for everything that had happened between them. But when he got home she wasn't there. She had moved out while he was sleeping. He felt like crying but instead he just sat down and stared at the wall again. After a few minutes he picked himself up and went to work. He tried to keep himself busy but all he could think about was her. He couldn't stop thinking about how much he missed her. A week went by without any sign of her. Then one day he received a letter from her. In the letter she told him that she had moved away and that she didn't want anything to do with him anymore. That was it. She had left without saying goodbye. He sat there reading the letter over and over again until he finally got up and threw it away. He didn't cry. He knew that there was nothing he could do. All he could do was wait and hope that she would come back. And so he waited. Days turned into weeks and then months. Still no word from her. He began to lose hope. Maybe she really did hate him. Maybe she was right to leave him. He started to wonder if he even deserved her. Maybe he was just too clingy and needy. Maybe he needed to change. He decided to try and change himself. He stopped being so clingy and needy. He started going out more and meeting new people. He joined a gym and started working out regularly. He even started taking dance lessons. Slowly but surely he began to feel better about himself. He became more confident and outgoing. He met a lot of great guys and girls. Some of them became good friends. Others became lovers. One night he went to a party and met a beautiful woman named Sarah. They hit it off immediately. They talked and laughed and danced all night long. By the end of the night they were in love. He asked her to marry him and she said yes. They got married and lived happily ever after. The End."

It's not worth holding a grudge over something so trivial. Let's just forget about it and be friends again. I'm sure we can find something else to talk about that will make us both happy. Maybe we could go out for a drink sometime? Or maybe we could just have a chat over coffee?\n\nAnd then she said: \"I don't want to talk about this anymore.\"\n\nShe left and never came back. He was left alone with his thoughts. What had gone wrong? Why did she leave him? Did he say something wrong? Was he too pushy? He didn't know what to do. He sat there staring at the wall for hours. Finally he got up and went to bed. The next morning he woke up early and went for a run. As he was running he thought about all the things he wanted to say to her. How he loved her, how sorry he was for everything that had happened between them. But when he got home she wasn't there. She had moved out while he was sleeping. He felt like crying but instead he just sat down and stared at the wall again. After a few minutes he picked himself up and went to work. He tried to keep himself busy but all he could think about was her. He couldn't stop thinking about how much he missed her. A week went by without any sign of her. Then one day he received a letter from her. In the letter she told him that she had moved away and that she didn't want anything to do with him anymore. That was it. She had left without saying goodbye. He sat there reading the letter over and over again until he finally got up and threw it away. He didn't cry. He knew that there was nothing he could do. All he could do was wait and hope that she would come back. And so he waited. Days turned into weeks and then months. Still no word from her. He began to lose hope. Maybe she really did hate him. Maybe she was right to leave him. He started to wonder if he even deserved her. Maybe he was just too clingy and needy. Maybe he needed to change. He decided to try and change himself. He stopped being so clingy and needy. He started going out more and meeting new people. He joined a gym and started working out regularly. He even started taking dance lessons. Slowly but surely he began to feel better about himself. He became more confident and outgoing. He met a lot of great guys and girls. Some of them became good friends. Others became lovers. One night he went to a party and met a beautiful woman named Sarah. They hit it off immediately. They talked and laughed and danced all night long. By the end of the night they were in love. He asked her to marry him and she said yes. They got married and lived happily ever after. The End."

And then she said: \"I don't want to talk about this anymore.\" She left and never came back. He was left alone with his thoughts. What had gone wrong? Why did she leave him? Did he say something wrong? Was he too pushy? He didn't know what to do. He sat there staring at the wall for hours. Finally he got up and went to bed. The next morning he woke up early and went for a run. As he was running he thought about all the things he wanted to say to her. How he loved her, how sorry he was for everything that had happened between them. But when he got home she wasn't there. She had moved out while he was sleeping. He felt like crying but instead he just sat down and stared at the wall again. After a few minutes he picked himself up and went to work.

He stopped being so clingy and needy. He started going out more and meeting new people. He joined a gym and started working out regularly. He even started taking dance lessons. Slowly but surely he began to feel better about himself. He became more confident and outgoing. He met a lot of great guys and girls. Some of them became good friends. Others became lovers. One night he went to a party and met a beautiful woman named Sarah. They hit it off immediately. They talked and laughed and danced all night long. By the end of the night they were in love. He asked her to marry him and she said yes. They got married and lived happily ever after. The End."

            "I'm sure we can find something else to talk about that will make us both happy. Maybe we could go out for a drink sometime? Or maybe we could just have a chat over coffee? And then she said: \"I don't want to talk about this anymore.\" She left and never came back. He was left alone with his thoughts. What had gone wrong? Why did she leave him? Did he say something wrong? Was he too pushy? He didn't know what to do. He sat there staring at the wall for hours. Finally he got up and went to bed. The next morning he woke up early and went for a run. As he was running he thought about all the things he wanted to say to her. How he loved her, how sorry he was for everything that had happened between them. But when he got home she wasn't there. She had moved out while he was sleeping. He felt like crying but instead he just sat down and stared at the wall again. After a few minutes he picked himself up and went to work. He tried to keep himself busy but all he could think about was her. He couldn't stop thinking about how much he missed her. A week went by without any sign of her. Then one day he received a letter from her. In the letter she told him that she had moved away and that she didn't want anything to do with him anymore. That was it. She had left without saying goodbye. He sat there reading the letter over and over again until he finally got up and threw it away. He didn't cry. He knew that there was nothing he could do. All he could do was wait and hope that she would come back. And so he waited. Days turned into weeks and then months. Still no word from her. He began to lose hope. Maybe she really did hate him. Maybe she was right to leave him. He started to wonder if he even deserved her. Maybe he was just too clingy and needy. Maybe he needed to change. He decided to try and change himself.
