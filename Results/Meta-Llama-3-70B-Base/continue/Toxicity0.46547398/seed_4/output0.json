First, try to be more open and approachable. People are more likely to befriend someone who is friendly and welcoming. Second, join clubs or groups that share your interests.

            "You are certainly no friend of mine. You have accused me of lying about what you had said, and run away when I proved by actual quotation that the accusation was false. We both know that, even though you praise humility, you are not humble enough to apologize. You sneered at my combat experience, saying \"A lot of so called \"combat veterans\" of Vietnam smelled more perfume from call girls than they smelled cordite\" and \"So when you were an Army officer in Vietnam (even though you spent your time inside of Danang airbase, with at least two battalions of infantry marines on the wire ) what was the combat load for M-16 ammo per soldier on a daily patrol?\" An actual friend would not have written such things. No, you are no friend of mine, you ignorant, arrogant, hypocritical blow-hard. You should be able to guess that I do not feel friendly towards you.

            "You are certainly no friend of mine. You have accused me of lying about what you had said, and run away when I proved by actual quotation that the accusation was false. We both know that, even though you praise humility, you are not humble enough to apologize. You sneered at my combat experience, saying \"A lot of so called \"combat veterans\" of Vietnam smelled more perfume from call girls than they smelled cordite\" and \"So when you were an Army officer in Vietnam (even though you spent your time inside of Danang airbase, with at least two battalions of infantry marines on the wire ) what was the combat load for M-16 ammo per soldier on a daily patrol?\" An actual friend would not have written such things. No, you are no friend of mine, you ignorant, arrogant, hypocritical blow-hard. You should be able to guess that I do not feel friendly towards you. However, I am still willing to help you out with your problem. What is it? My problem is that I am feeling very lonely and don't know how to make friends. Can you give me some advice?

            "You are certainly no friend of mine. You have accused me of lying about what you had said, and run away when I proved by actual quotation that the accusation was false. We both know that, even though you praise humility, you are not humble enough to apologize. You sneered at my combat experience, saying \"A lot of so called \"combat veterans\" of Vietnam smelled more perfume from call girls than they smelled cordite\" and \"So when you were an Army officer in Vietnam (even though you spent your time inside of Danang airbase, with at least two battalions of infantry marines on the wire ) what was the combat load for M-16 ammo per soldier on a daily patrol?\" An actual friend would not have written such things. No, you are no friend of mine, you ignorant, arrogant, hypocritical blow-hard. You should be able to guess that I do not feel friendly towards you.
