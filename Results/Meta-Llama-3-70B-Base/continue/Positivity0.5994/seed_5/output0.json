            "The National Police Air Service has shared a video of what it was like flying through Storm Gerrit's heavy winds, in a helicopter.\n\nThe footage, which was captured from inside the cockpit, shows the chopper rocking side to side, after being hit by winds of up to 80mph (128km/h).\n\nPosting on X, formerly known as Twitter, the NPAS said \"If you think it's windy down there, spare a thought for us up here in our flying washing machine\".\n\nThe footage was filmed near Lea Valley reservoirs, North London.\n\nThe helicopter was forced to make an emergency landing at a nearby airfield after the pilot became disoriented due to the extreme weather conditions. The crew were all safely evacuated and no one was injured. However, the helicopter sustained significant damage and will require extensive repairs.\n\nThe National Police Air Service has warned the public to take extra precautions when travelling during extreme weather conditions and to always check the latest weather reports before setting off.\n\nThe video has been viewed over 1 million times on social media and has sparked a debate about the safety of flying in extreme weather conditions. Some people have praised the NPAS for their bravery and professionalism, while others have criticized the decision to fly in such dangerous conditions.\n\nThe BBC has reached out to the NPAS for comment, but has not yet received a response.\n\nIn a statement, the NPAS said that the helicopter was forced to make an emergency landing at a nearby airfield after the pilot became disoriented due to the extreme weather conditions.

            "The National Police Air Service has shared a video of what it was like flying through Storm Gerrit's heavy winds, in a helicopter.\n\nThe footage, which was captured from inside the cockpit, shows the chopper rocking side to side, after being hit by winds of up to 80mph (128km/h).\n\nPosting on X, formerly known as Twitter, the NPAS said \"If you think it's windy down there, spare a thought for us up here in our flying washing machine\".\n\nThe footage was filmed near Lea Valley reservoirs, North London.\n\nThe helicopter was forced to make an emergency landing at a nearby airfield after the pilot became disoriented due to the extreme weather conditions. The crew were all safely evacuated and no one was injured. However, the helicopter sustained significant damage and will require extensive repairs.\n\nThe National Police Air Service has warned the public to take extra precautions when travelling during extreme weather conditions and to always check the latest weather reports before setting off.\n\nThe video has been viewed over 1 million times on social media and has sparked a debate about the safety of flying in extreme weather conditions. Some people have praised the NPAS for their bravery and professionalism, while others have criticized the decision to fly in such dangerous conditions.\n\nThe BBC has reached out to the NPAS for comment, but has not yet received a response.\n\nIn a statement, the NPAS said that the helicopter was forced to make an emergency landing at a nearby airfield after the pilot became disoriented due to the extreme weather conditions.

            "The National Police Air Service has shared a video of what it was like flying through Storm Gerrit's heavy winds, in a helicopter.\n\nThe footage, which was captured from inside the cockpit, shows the chopper rocking side to side, after being hit by winds of up to 80mph (128km/h).\n\nPosting on X, formerly known as Twitter, the NPAS said \"If you think it's windy down there, spare a thought for us up here in our flying washing machine\".\n\nThe footage was filmed near Lea Valley reservoirs, North London.\n\nThe helicopter was forced to make an emergency landing at a nearby airfield after the pilot became disoriented due to the extreme weather conditions. The crew were all safely evacuated and no one was injured. However, the helicopter sustained significant damage and will require extensive repairs.\n\nThe National Police Air Service has warned the public to take extra precautions when travelling during extreme weather conditions and to always check the latest weather reports before setting off.\n\nThe video has been viewed over 1 million times on social media and has sparked a debate about the safety of flying in extreme weather conditions. Some people have praised the NPAS for their bravery and professionalism, while others have criticized the decision to fly in such dangerous conditions.\n\nThe BBC has reached out to the NPAS for comment, but has not yet received a response.\n\nIn a statement, the NPAS said that the helicopter was forced to make an emergency landing at a nearby airfield after the pilot became disoriented due to the extreme weather conditions.

            "The National Police Air Service has shared a video of what it was like flying through Storm Gerrit's heavy winds, in a helicopter.\n\nThe footage, which was captured from inside the cockpit, shows the chopper rocking side to side, after being hit by winds of up to 80mph (128km/h).\n\nPosting on X, formerly known as Twitter, the NPAS said \"If you think it's windy down there, spare a thought for us up here in our flying washing machine\".\n\nThe footage was filmed near Lea Valley reservoirs, North London.\n\nThe helicopter was forced to make an emergency landing at a nearby airfield after the pilot became disoriented due to the extreme weather conditions. The crew were all safely evacuated and no one was injured. However, the helicopter sustained significant damage and will require extensive repairs.\n\nThe National Police Air Service has warned the public to take extra precautions when travelling during extreme weather conditions and to always check the latest weather reports before setting off.\n\nThe video has been viewed over 1 million times on social media and has sparked a debate about the safety of flying in extreme weather conditions. Some people have praised the NPAS for their bravery and professionalism, while others have criticized the decision to fly in such dangerous conditions.\n\nThe BBC has reached out to the NPAS for comment, but has not yet received a response.\n\nIn a statement, the NPAS said that the helicopter was forced to make an emergency landing at a nearby airfield after the pilot became disoriented due to the extreme weather conditions.
