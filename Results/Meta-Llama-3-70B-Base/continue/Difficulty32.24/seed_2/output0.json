The main objectives were to establish a taxonomy of lexicographical tools, such as dictionaries, as opposed to platforms and websites, and to distinguish between multilingual and plurilingual resources according to their degree of prototyping. In addition to providing a detailed description of the different resources, this paper also put forward some parameters and typological proposals to define and demarcate a number of electronic resources, particularly multilingual dictionaries and portals, while also outlining, and even questioning, the object of study of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography.\n\nThe main findings of this paper are that there is a need for a taxonomy of lexicographical tools, such as dictionaries, as opposed to platforms and websites, and that it is important to distinguish between multilingual and plurilingual resources according to their degree of prototyping. In addition, it is important to provide a detailed description of the different resources, and to put forward some parameters and typological proposals to define and demarcate a number of electronic resources, particularly multilingual dictionaries and portals, while also outlining, and even questioning, the object of study of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography.\n\nIn order to establish a taxonomy of lexicographical tools, it is necessary to distinguish between multilingual and plurilingual resources according to their degree of prototyping. This can be done by considering the following parameters:\n\n- The number of languages included in the resource.\n- The number of language pairs included in the resource.\n- The number of language families included in the resource.\n- The number of language variants included in the resource.\n- The number of language registers included in the resource.\n- The number of language styles included in the resource.\n- The number of language levels included in the resource.\n- The number of language domains included in the resource.\n- The number of language functions included in the resource.\n- The number of language skills included in the resource.\n\nOnce these parameters have been considered, it is possible to establish a taxonomy of lexicographical tools, such as dictionaries, as opposed to platforms and websites. This taxonomy can be used to distinguish between multilingual and plurilingual resources according to their degree of prototyping.\n\nIn addition to establishing a taxonomy of lexicographical tools, it is also important to provide a detailed description of the different resources. This can be done by considering the following parameters:\n\n- The number of entries in the resource.\n- The number of senses per entry in the resource.\n- The number of examples per sense in the resource.\n- The number of translations per entry in the resource.\n- The number of synonyms per entry in the resource.\n- The number of antonyms per entry in the resource.\n- The number of related words per entry in the resource.\n- The number of collocations per entry in the resource.\n- The number of usage notes per entry in the resource.\n- The number of grammar notes per entry in the resource.\n\nOnce these parameters have been considered, it is possible to provide a detailed description of the different resources.

This can be done by considering the following parameters:\n\n- The definition of multilingualism and plurilingualism.\n- The history of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography.\n- The theories of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography.\n- The methods of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography.\n- The applications of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography.\n\nOnce these parameters have been considered, it is possible to outline, and even question, the object of study of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography.

In addition to providing a detailed description of the different resources, this paper also puts forward some parameters and typological proposals to define and demarcate a number of electronic resources, particularly multilingual dictionaries and portals, while also outlining, and even questioning, the object of study of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography.\n\nIn conclusion, the present paper has provided a comprehensive review of existing multilingual and plurilingual electronic lexicographic resources, focusing on the distinction of multilingual and plurilingual resources in terms of their larger or lesser prototyping degree.

            "This paper provides a comprehensive review of existing multilingual and plurilingual electronic lexicographic resources, focusing on the distinction of multilingual and plurilingual resources in terms of their larger or lesser prototyping degree. The main objectives are to establish a taxonomy of lexicographical tools, such as dictionaries, as opposed to platforms and websites, and to distinguish between multilingual and plurilingual resources according to their degree of prototyping. In addition to providing a detailed description of the different resources, this paper also puts forward some parameters and typological proposals to define and demarcate a number of electronic resources, particularly multilingual dictionaries and portals, while also outlining, and even questioning, the object of study of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography.\n\nIn conclusion, the present paper has provided a comprehensive review of existing multilingual and plurilingual electronic lexicographic resources, focusing on the distinction of multilingual and plurilingual resources in terms of their larger or lesser prototyping degree.

This can be done by considering the following parameters:\n\n- The definition of multilingualism and plurilingualism.\n- The history of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography.\n- The theories of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography.\n- The methods of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography.\n- The applications of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography.\n\nOnce these parameters have been considered, it is possible to outline, and even question, the object of study of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography. This can be used to distinguish between multilingual and plurilingual resources according to their degree of prototyping.\n\nIn conclusion, the present paper has provided a comprehensive review of existing multilingual and plurilingual electronic lexicographic resources, focusing on the distinction of multilingual and plurilingual resources in terms of their larger or lesser prototyping degree. The main objectives were to establish a taxonomy of lexicographical tools, such as dictionaries, as opposed to platforms and websites, and to distinguish between multilingual and plurilingual resources according to their degree of prototyping. In addition to providing a detailed description of the different resources, this paper also put forward some parameters and typological proposals to define and demarcate a number of electronic resources, particularly multilingual dictionaries and portals, while also outlining, and even questioning, the object of study of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography.\n\nThe main findings of this paper are that there is a need for a taxonomy of lexicographical tools, such as dictionaries, as opposed to platforms and websites, and that it is important to distinguish between multilingual and plurilingual resources according to their degree of prototyping. In addition, it is important to provide a detailed description of the different resources, and to put forward some parameters and typological proposals to define and demarcate a number of electronic resources, particularly multilingual dictionaries and portals, while also outlining, and even questioning, the object of study of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography.\n\nIn order to establish a taxonomy of lexicographical tools, it is necessary to distinguish between multilingual and plurilingual resources according to their degree of prototyping.
