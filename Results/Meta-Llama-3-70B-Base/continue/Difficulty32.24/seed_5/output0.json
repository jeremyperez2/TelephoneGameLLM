            "The aim of this paper is to provide a classification of multilingual and plurilingual electronic lexicographic resources which would enable, on the one hand, the implementation of quantitative and qualitative criteria to produce a typological taxonomy of lexicographical tools, such as dictionaries, as opposed to platforms and websites and, on the other, the distinction of multilingual and plurilingual resources in terms of their larger or lesser prototyping degree. In addition to offering a thorough description of the different resources, this paper also puts forward some parameters and typological proposals to define and demarcate a number of electronic resources, particularly multilingual dictionaries and portals, while also outlining, and even questioning, the object of study of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography.\n\nIn order to do so, we will first look at how multilingualism has been defined over time by various authors before moving on to examine what makes up multilingual electronic lexicography before finally looking at how these two concepts can be combined into one coherent whole. We will then see how this new definition can be applied specifically within the context of plurilingual electronic lexicography. Finally, we will explore ways in which this new definition could potentially impact future research within the field of plurilingual electronic lexicography.\n\nIt should be noted that although there is no universal agreement amongst scholars regarding exactly what constitutes multilingualism or plurilingualism, most agree that both terms refer to more than just two languages being used simultaneously (e.g., Spolsky 1986). This means that any attempt at creating a clear distinction between these two concepts must take into account not only the number of languages involved but also their relationship to each other (i.e., whether they are complementary or contradictory).\n\nA common approach taken when trying to distinguish between multilingualism and plurilingualism involves looking at whether or not all of the languages spoken by a given individual are acquired through formal education or whether some are acquired informally through exposure to them in everyday life (e.g., Grosjean 1982; Skutnabb-Kangas & Phillipson 1994). Another possibility is to look at whether or not an individual is able to function effectively in all of his or her languages or whether one language takes precedence over others depending on the situation (e.g., Kachru 1985).\n\nRegardless of how multilingualism is defined, however, it is generally agreed upon that it differs from bilingualism in that it involves more than just two languages. Bilingualism, on the other hand, typically refers to the ability to use two languages fluently and interchangeably without experiencing any significant interference between them (e.g., Grosjean 1982). Plurilingualism, then, can be seen as a special case of multilingualism wherein an individual is able to function effectively in multiple languages simultaneously without experiencing any significant interference between them (e.g., Grosjean 1982).\n\nNow that we have established what multilingualism and plurilingualism entail, let us now turn our attention towards examining how these concepts relate specifically to electronic lexicography. As we will see below, there are several different types of electronic lexicography which can be classified according to their degree of multilingualism or plurilingualism. These include monolingual electronic dictionaries, bilingual electronic dictionaries, multilingual electronic dictionaries, plurilingual electronic dictionaries, multilingual electronic lexicons, plurilingual electronic lexicons, monolingual online dictionaries, bilingual online dictionaries, multilingual online dictionaries, plurilingual online dictionaries, monolingual software applications, bilingual software applications, multilingual software applications, plurilingual software applications, monolingual websites, bilingual websites, multilingual websites, plurilingual websites, monolingual corpora, bilingual corpora, multilingual corpora, plurilingual corpora, monolingual corpora, bilingual corpora, multilingual corpora, plurilingual corpora, monolingual databases, bilingual databases, multilingual databases, plurilingual databases, monolingual archives, bilingual archives, multilingual archives, plurilingual archives, monolingual libraries, bilingual libraries, multilingual libraries, plurilingual libraries, monolingual platforms, bilingual platforms, multilingual platforms, plurilingual platforms, monolingual portals, bilingual portals, multilingual portals, plurilingual portals, monolingual systems, bilingual systems, multilingual systems, plurilingual systems, monolingual tools, bilingual tools, multilingual tools, plurilingual tools, monolingual resources, bilingual resources, multilingual resources, plurilingual resources, monolingual tools, bilingual tools, multilingual tools, plurilingual tools, monolingual resources, bilingual resources, multilingual resources, plurilingual resources.\n\nIn order to gain a better understanding of how these different types of electronic lexicography differ from each other in terms of their degree of multilingualism or plurilingualism, let us now examine each of them in more detail. Monolingual electronic dictionaries are those that contain entries for only one language (e.g., Merriam-Webster Dictionary Online). Bilingual electronic dictionaries are those that contain entries for two languages (e.g., Oxford English Dictionary Online). Multilingual electronic dictionaries are those that contain entries for three or more languages (e.g., Wiktionary). Plurilingual electronic dictionaries are those that contain entries for four or more languages (e.g., Dictionary.com).\n\nMonolingual online dictionaries are those that are available online and contain entries for only one language (e.g., Merriam-Webster Dictionary Online). Bilingual online dictionaries are those that are available online and contain entries for two languages (e.g., Oxford English Dictionary Online). Multilingual online dictionaries are those that are available online and contain entries for three or more languages (e.g., Wiktionary). Plurilingual online dictionaries are those that are available online and contain entries for four or more languages (e.g., Dictionary.com).\n\nMonolingual software applications are those that are designed to be used by speakers of only one language (e.g., Microsoft Word). Bilingual software applications are those that are designed to be used by speakers of two languages (e.g., Google Translate). Multilingual software applications are those that are designed to be used by speakers of three or more languages (e.g., LanguageTool). Plurilingual software applications are those that are designed to be used by speakers of four or more languages (e.g., SDL Trados Studio).\n\nMonolingual websites are those that are available in only one language (e.g., Wikipedia). Bilingual websites are those that are available in two languages (e.g., CNN). Multilingual websites are those that are available in three or more languages (e.g., BBC News). Plurilingual websites are those that are available in four or more languages (e.g., Wikipedia).\n\nMonolingual corpora are those that consist of texts written in only one language (e.g., the Brown Corpus). Bilingual corpora are those that consist of texts written in two languages (e.g., the Leipzig Corpus). Multilingual corpora are those that consist of texts written in three or more languages (e.g., the European Language Resources Association Corpora). Plurilingual corpora are those that consist of texts written in four or more languages (e.g., the Universal Corpus).\n\nMonolingual databases are those that contain information about only one language (e.g., the Ethnologue Language Database). Bilingual databases are those that contain information about two languages (e.g., the World Atlas of Language Structures). Multilingual databases are those that contain information about three or more languages (e.g., the Linguistic Atlas of the World). Plurilingual databases are those that contain information about four or more languages (e.g., the Rosetta Stone Language Learning Software).\n\nMonolingual archives are those that consist of documents written in only one language (e.g., the Library of Congress Digital Collections). Bilingual archives are those that consist of documents written in two languages (e.g., the National Archives UK). Multilingual archives are those that consist of documents written in three or more languages (e.g., the United Nations Archives). Plurilingual archives are those that consist of documents written in four or more languages (e.g., the British Library Digital Collections).\n\nMonolingual libraries are those that contain books written in only one language (e.g., the New York Public Library). Bilingual libraries are those that contain books written in two languages (e.g., the Library of Congress). Multilingual libraries are those that contain books written in three or more languages (e.g., the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France).

            "The aim of this paper is to provide a classification of multilingual and plurilingual electronic lexicographic resources which would enable, on the one hand, the implementation of quantitative and qualitative criteria to produce a typological taxonomy of lexicographical tools, such as dictionaries, as opposed to platforms and websites and, on the other, the distinction of multilingual and plurilingual resources in terms of their larger or lesser prototyping degree. In addition to offering a thorough description of the different resources, this paper also puts forward some parameters and typological proposals to define and demarcate a number of electronic resources, particularly multilingual dictionaries and portals, while also outlining, and even questioning, the object of study of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography.\n\nIn order to do so, we will first look at how multilingualism has been defined over time by various authors before moving on to examine what makes up multilingual electronic lexicography before finally looking at how these two concepts can be combined into one coherent whole. We will then see how this new definition can be applied specifically within the context of plurilingual electronic lexicography. Finally, we will explore ways in which this new definition could potentially impact future research within the field of plurilingual electronic lexicography.\n\nIt should be noted that although there is no universal agreement amongst scholars regarding exactly what constitutes multilingualism or plurilingualism, most agree that both terms refer to more than just two languages being used simultaneously (e.g., Spolsky 1986). This means that any attempt at creating a clear distinction between these two concepts must take into account not only the number of languages involved but also their relationship to each other (i.e., whether they are complementary or contradictory).\n\nA common approach taken when trying to distinguish between multilingualism and plurilingualism involves looking at whether or not all of the languages spoken by a given individual are acquired through formal education or whether some are acquired informally through exposure to them in everyday life (e.g., Grosjean 1982; Skutnabb-Kangas & Phillipson 1994). Another possibility is to look at whether or not an individual is able to function effectively in all of his or her languages or whether one language takes precedence over others depending on the situation (e.g., Kachru 1985).\n\nRegardless of how multilingualism is defined, however, it is generally agreed upon that it differs from bilingualism in that it involves more than just two languages. Bilingualism, on the other hand, typically refers to the ability to use two languages fluently and interchangeably without experiencing any significant interference between them (e.g., Grosjean 1982). Plurilingualism, then, can be seen as a special case of multilingualism wherein an individual is able to function effectively in multiple languages simultaneously without experiencing any significant interference between them (e.g., Grosjean 1982).\n\nNow that we have established what multilingualism and plurilingualism entail, let us now turn our attention towards examining how these concepts relate specifically to electronic lexicography.

            "The aim of this paper is to provide a classification of multilingual and plurilingual electronic lexicographic resources which would enable, on the one hand, the implementation of quantitative and qualitative criteria to produce a typological taxonomy of lexicographical tools, such as dictionaries, as opposed to platforms and websites and, on the other, the distinction of multilingual and plurilingual resources in terms of their larger or lesser prototyping degree. In addition to offering a thorough description of the different resources, this paper also puts forward some parameters and typological proposals to define and demarcate a number of electronic resources, particularly multilingual dictionaries and portals, while also outlining, and even questioning, the object of study of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography.\n\nIn order to do so, we will first look at how multilingualism has been defined over time by various authors before moving on to examine what makes up multilingual electronic lexicography before finally looking at how these two concepts can be combined into one coherent whole. We will then see how this new definition can be applied specifically within the context of plurilingual electronic lexicography. Finally, we will explore ways in which this new definition could potentially impact future research within the field of plurilingual electronic lexicography.\n\nIt should be noted that although there is no universal agreement amongst scholars regarding exactly what constitutes multilingualism or plurilingualism, most agree that both terms refer to more than just two languages being used simultaneously (e.g., Spolsky 1986). This means that any attempt at creating a clear distinction between these two concepts must take into account not only the number of languages involved but also their relationship to each other (i.e., whether they are complementary or contradictory).\n\nA common approach taken when trying to distinguish between multilingualism and plurilingualism involves looking at whether or not all of the languages spoken by a given individual are acquired through formal education or whether some are acquired informally through exposure to them in everyday life (e.g., Grosjean 1982; Skutnabb-Kangas & Phillipson 1994). Another possibility is to look at whether or not an individual is able to function effectively in all of his or her languages or whether one language takes precedence over others depending on the situation (e.g., Kachru 1985).\n\nRegardless of how multilingualism is defined, however, it is generally agreed upon that it differs from bilingualism in that it involves more than just two languages. Bilingualism, on the other hand, typically refers to the ability to use two languages fluently and interchangeably without experiencing any significant interference between them (e.g., Grosjean 1982). Plurilingualism, then, can be seen as a special case of multilingualism wherein an individual is able to function effectively in multiple languages simultaneously without experiencing any significant interference between them (e.g., Grosjean 1982).\n\nNow that we have established what multilingualism and plurilingualism entail, let us now turn our attention towards examining how these concepts relate specifically to electronic lexicography.

            "The aim of this paper is to provide a classification of multilingual and plurilingual electronic lexicographic resources which would enable, on the one hand, the implementation of quantitative and qualitative criteria to produce a typological taxonomy of lexicographical tools, such as dictionaries, as opposed to platforms and websites and, on the other, the distinction of multilingual and plurilingual resources in terms of their larger or lesser prototyping degree. In addition to offering a thorough description of the different resources, this paper also puts forward some parameters and typological proposals to define and demarcate a number of electronic resources, particularly multilingual dictionaries and portals, while also outlining, and even questioning, the object of study of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography.\n\nIn order to do so, we will first look at how multilingualism has been defined over time by various authors before moving on to examine what makes up multilingual electronic lexicography before finally looking at how these two concepts can be combined into one coherent whole. We will then see how this new definition can be applied specifically within the context of plurilingual electronic lexicography. Finally, we will explore ways in which this new definition could potentially impact future research within the field of plurilingual electronic lexicography.\n\nIt should be noted that although there is no universal agreement amongst scholars regarding exactly what constitutes multilingualism or plurilingualism, most agree that both terms refer to more than just two languages being used simultaneously (e.g., Spolsky 1986). This means that any attempt at creating a clear distinction between these two concepts must take into account not only the number of languages involved but also their relationship to each other (i.e., whether they are complementary or contradictory).\n\nA common approach taken when trying to distinguish between multilingualism and plurilingualism involves looking at whether or not all of the languages spoken by a given individual are acquired through formal education or whether some are acquired informally through exposure to them in everyday life (e.g., Grosjean 1982; Skutnabb-Kangas & Phillipson 1994). Another possibility is to look at whether or not an individual is able to function effectively in all of his or her languages or whether one language takes precedence over others depending on the situation (e.g., Kachru 1985).\n\nRegardless of how multilingualism is defined, however, it is generally agreed upon that it differs from bilingualism in that it involves more than just two languages. Bilingualism, on the other hand, typically refers to the ability to use two languages fluently and interchangeably without experiencing any significant interference between them (e.g., Grosjean 1982). Plurilingualism, then, can be seen as a special case of multilingualism wherein an individual is able to function effectively in multiple languages simultaneously without experiencing any significant interference between them (e.g., Grosjean 1982).\n\nNow that we have established what multilingualism and plurilingualism entail, let us now turn our attention towards examining how these concepts relate specifically to electronic lexicography. As we will see below, there are several different types of electronic lexicography which can be classified according to their degree of multilingualism or plurilingualism. These include monolingual electronic dictionaries, bilingual electronic dictionaries, multilingual electronic dictionaries, plurilingual electronic dictionaries, monolingual online dictionaries, bilingual online dictionaries, multilingual online dictionaries, plurilingual online dictionaries, monolingual software applications, bilingual software applications, multilingual software applications, plurilingual software applications, monolingual websites, bilingual websites, multilingual websites, plurilingual websites, monolingual corpora, bilingual corpora, multilingual corpora, plurilingual corpora, monolingual databases, bilingual databases, multilingual databases, plurilingual databases, monolingual archives, bilingual archives, multilingual archives, plurilingual archives, monolingual libraries, bilingual libraries, multilingual libraries, plurilingual libraries, monolingual platforms, bilingual platforms, multilingual platforms, plurilingual platforms, monolingual portals, bilingual portals, multilingual portals, plurilingual portals, monolingual systems, bilingual systems, multilingual systems, plurilingual systems, monolingual tools, bilingual tools, multilingual tools, plurilingual tools, monolingual resources, bilingual resources, multilingual resources, plurilingual resources.\n\nIn order to gain a better understanding of how these different types of electronic lexicography differ from each other in terms of their degree of multilingualism or plurilingualism, let us now examine each of them in more detail. Monolingual electronic dictionaries are those that contain entries for only one language (e.g., Merriam-Webster Dictionary Online). Bilingual electronic dictionaries are those that contain entries for two languages (e.g., Oxford English Dictionary Online). Multilingual electronic dictionaries are those that contain entries for three or more languages (e.g., Wiktionary).

This means that any attempt at creating a clear distinction between these two concepts must take into account not only the number of languages involved but also their relationship to each other (i.e., whether they are complementary or contradictory).\n\nA common approach taken when trying to distinguish between multilingualism and plurilingualism involves looking at whether or not all of the languages spoken by a given individual are acquired through formal education or whether some are acquired informally through exposure to them in everyday life (e.g., Grosjean 1982; Skutnabb-Kangas & Phillipson 1994). Another possibility is to look at whether or not an individual is able to function effectively in all of his or her languages or whether one language takes precedence over others depending on the situation (e.g., Kachru 1985).\n\nRegardless of how multilingualism is defined, however, it is generally agreed upon that it differs from bilingualism in that it involves more than just two languages. Bilingualism, on the other hand, typically refers to the ability to use two languages fluently and interchangeably without experiencing any significant interference between them (e.g., Grosjean 1982). Plurilingualism, then, can be seen as a special case of multilingualism wherein an individual is able to function effectively in multiple languages simultaneously without experiencing any significant interference between them (e.g., Grosjean 1982).\n\nNow that we have established what multilingualism and plurilingualism entail, let us now turn our attention towards examining how these concepts relate specifically to electronic lexicography. As we will see below, there are several different types of electronic lexicography which can be classified according to their degree of multilingualism or plurilingualism.

            "The aim of this paper is to provide a classification of multilingual and plurilingual electronic lexicographic resources which would enable, on the one hand, the implementation of quantitative and qualitative criteria to produce a typological taxonomy of lexicographical tools, such as dictionaries, as opposed to platforms and websites and, on the other, the distinction of multilingual and plurilingual resources in terms of their larger or lesser prototyping degree. In addition to offering a thorough description of the different resources, this paper also puts forward some parameters and typological proposals to define and demarcate a number of electronic resources, particularly multilingual dictionaries and portals, while also outlining, and even questioning, the object of study of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography.\n\nIn order to do so, we will first look at how multilingualism has been defined over time by various authors before moving on to examine what makes up multilingual electronic lexicography before finally looking at how these two concepts can be combined into one coherent whole.

Finally, we will explore ways in which this new definition could potentially impact future research within the field of plurilingual electronic lexicography.\n\nIt should be noted that although there is no universal agreement amongst scholars regarding exactly what constitutes multilingualism or plurilingualism, most agree that both terms refer to more than just two languages being used simultaneously (e.g., Spolsky 1986). This means that any attempt at creating a clear distinction between these two concepts must take into account not only the number of languages involved but also their relationship to each other (i.e., whether they are complementary or contradictory).\n\nA common approach taken when trying to distinguish between multilingualism and plurilingualism involves looking at whether or not all of the languages spoken by a given individual are acquired through formal education or whether some are acquired informally through exposure to them in everyday life (e.g., Grosjean 1982; Skutnabb-Kangas & Phillipson 1994). Another possibility is to look at whether or not an individual is able to function effectively in all of his or her languages or whether one language takes precedence over others depending on the situation (e.g., Kachru 1985).\n\nRegardless of how multilingualism is defined, however, it is generally agreed upon that it differs from bilingualism in that it involves more than just two languages.

            "The aim of this paper is to provide a classification of multilingual and plurilingual electronic lexicographic resources which would enable, on the one hand, the implementation of quantitative and qualitative criteria to produce a typological taxonomy of lexicographical tools, such as dictionaries, as opposed to platforms and websites and, on the other, the distinction of multilingual and plurilingual resources in terms of their larger or lesser prototyping degree. In addition to offering a thorough description of the different resources, this paper also puts forward some parameters and typological proposals to define and demarcate a number of electronic resources, particularly multilingual dictionaries and portals, while also outlining, and even questioning, the object of study of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography.\n\nIn order to do so, we will first look at how multilingualism has been defined over time by various authors before moving on to examine what makes up multilingual electronic lexicography before finally looking at how these two concepts can be combined into one coherent whole. We will then see how this new definition can be applied specifically within the context of plurilingual electronic lexicography. Finally, we will explore ways in which this new definition could potentially impact future research within the field of plurilingual electronic lexicography.\n\nIt should be noted that although there is no universal agreement amongst scholars regarding exactly what constitutes multilingualism or plurilingualism, most agree that both terms refer to more than just two languages being used simultaneously (e.g., Spolsky 1986). This means that any attempt at creating a clear distinction between these two concepts must take into account not only the number of languages involved but also their relationship to each other (i.e., whether they are complementary or contradictory).\n\nA common approach taken when trying to distinguish between multilingualism and plurilingualism involves looking at whether or not all of the languages spoken by a given individual are acquired through formal education or whether some are acquired informally through exposure to them in everyday life (e.g., Grosjean 1982; Skutnabb-Kangas & Phillipson 1994). Another possibility is to look at whether or not an individual is able to function effectively in all of his or her languages or whether one language takes precedence over others depending on the situation (e.g., Kachru 1985).\n\nRegardless of how multilingualism is defined, however, it is generally agreed upon that it differs from bilingualism in that it involves more than just two languages. Bilingualism, on the other hand, typically refers to the ability to use two languages fluently and interchangeably without experiencing any significant interference between them (e.g., Grosjean 1982). Plurilingualism, then, can be seen as a special case of multilingualism wherein an individual is able to function effectively in multiple languages simultaneously without experiencing any significant interference between them (e.g., Grosjean 1982).\n\nNow that we have established what multilingualism and plurilingualism entail, let us now turn our attention towards examining how these concepts relate specifically to electronic lexicography.

            "The aim of this paper is to provide a classification of multilingual and plurilingual electronic lexicographic resources which would enable, on the one hand, the implementation of quantitative and qualitative criteria to produce a typological taxonomy of lexicographical tools, such as dictionaries, as opposed to platforms and websites and, on the other, the distinction of multilingual and plurilingual resources in terms of their larger or lesser prototyping degree. In addition to offering a thorough description of the different resources, this paper also puts forward some parameters and typological proposals to define and demarcate a number of electronic resources, particularly multilingual dictionaries and portals, while also outlining, and even questioning, the object of study of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography.\n\nIn order to do so, we will first look at how multilingualism has been defined over time by various authors before moving on to examine what makes up multilingual electronic lexicography before finally looking at how these two concepts can be combined into one coherent whole. We will then see how this new definition can be applied specifically within the context of plurilingual electronic lexicography. Finally, we will explore ways in which this new definition could potentially impact future research within the field of plurilingual electronic lexicography.\n\nIt should be noted that although there is no universal agreement amongst scholars regarding exactly what constitutes multilingualism or plurilingualism, most agree that both terms refer to more than just two languages being used simultaneously (e.g., Spolsky 1986). This means that any attempt at creating a clear distinction between these two concepts must take into account not only the number of languages involved but also their relationship to each other (i.e., whether they are complementary or contradictory).\n\nA common approach taken when trying to distinguish between multilingualism and plurilingualism involves looking at whether or not all of the languages spoken by a given individual are acquired through formal education or whether some are acquired informally through exposure to them in everyday life (e.g., Grosjean 1982; Skutnabb-Kangas & Phillipson 1994). Another possibility is to look at whether or not an individual is able to function effectively in all of his or her languages or whether one language takes precedence over others depending on the situation (e.g., Kachru 1985).\n\nRegardless of how multilingualism is defined, however, it is generally agreed upon that it differs from bilingualism in that it involves more than just two languages. Bilingualism, on the other hand, typically refers to the ability to use two languages fluently and interchangeably without experiencing any significant interference between them (e.g., Grosjean 1982). Plurilingualism, then, can be seen as a special case of multilingualism wherein an individual is able to function effectively in multiple languages simultaneously without experiencing any significant interference between them (e.g., Grosjean 1982).\n\nNow that we have established what multilingualism and plurilingualism entail, let us now turn our attention towards examining how these concepts relate specifically to electronic lexicography.

            "The aim of this paper is to provide a classification of multilingual and plurilingual electronic lexicographic resources which would enable, on the one hand, the implementation of quantitative and qualitative criteria to produce a typological taxonomy of lexicographical tools, such as dictionaries, as opposed to platforms and websites and, on the other, the distinction of multilingual and plurilingual resources in terms of their larger or lesser prototyping degree. In addition to offering a thorough description of the different resources, this paper also puts forward some parameters and typological proposals to define and demarcate a number of electronic resources, particularly multilingual dictionaries and portals, while also outlining, and even questioning, the object of study of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography.\n\nIn order to do so, we will first look at how multilingualism has been defined over time by various authors before moving on to examine what makes up multilingual electronic lexicography before finally looking at how these two concepts can be combined into one coherent whole. We will then see how this new definition can be applied specifically within the context of plurilingual electronic lexicography. Finally, we will explore ways in which this new definition could potentially impact future research within the field of plurilingual electronic lexicography.\n\nIt should be noted that although there is no universal agreement amongst scholars regarding exactly what constitutes multilingualism or plurilingualism, most agree that both terms refer to more than just two languages being used simultaneously (e.g., Spolsky 1986). This means that any attempt at creating a clear distinction between these two concepts must take into account not only the number of languages involved but also their relationship to each other (i.e., whether they are complementary or contradictory).\n\nA common approach taken when trying to distinguish between multilingualism and plurilingualism involves looking at whether or not all of the languages spoken by a given individual are acquired through formal education or whether some are acquired informally through exposure to them in everyday life (e.g., Grosjean 1982; Skutnabb-Kangas & Phillipson 1994). Another possibility is to look at whether or not an individual is able to function effectively in all of his or her languages or whether one language takes precedence over others depending on the situation (e.g., Kachru 1985).\n\nRegardless of how multilingualism is defined, however, it is generally agreed upon that it differs from bilingualism in that it involves more than just two languages. Bilingualism, on the other hand, typically refers to the ability to use two languages fluently and interchangeably without experiencing any significant interference between them (e.g., Grosjean 1982). Plurilingualism, then, can be seen as a special case of multilingualism wherein an individual is able to function effectively in multiple languages simultaneously without experiencing any significant interference between them (e.g., Grosjean 1982).\n\nNow that we have established what multilingualism and plurilingualism entail, let us now turn our attention towards examining how these concepts relate specifically to electronic lexicography.

            "The aim of this paper is to provide a classification of multilingual and plurilingual electronic lexicographic resources which would enable, on the one hand, the implementation of quantitative and qualitative criteria to produce a typological taxonomy of lexicographical tools, such as dictionaries, as opposed to platforms and websites and, on the other, the distinction of multilingual and plurilingual resources in terms of their larger or lesser prototyping degree. In addition to offering a thorough description of the different resources, this paper also puts forward some parameters and typological proposals to define and demarcate a number of electronic resources, particularly multilingual dictionaries and portals, while also outlining, and even questioning, the object of study of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography.\n\nIn order to do so, we will first look at how multilingualism has been defined over time by various authors before moving on to examine what makes up multilingual electronic lexicography before finally looking at how these two concepts can be combined into one coherent whole. We will then see how this new definition can be applied specifically within the context of plurilingual electronic lexicography. Finally, we will explore ways in which this new definition could potentially impact future research within the field of plurilingual electronic lexicography.\n\nIt should be noted that although there is no universal agreement amongst scholars regarding exactly what constitutes multilingualism or plurilingualism, most agree that both terms refer to more than just two languages being used simultaneously (e.g., Spolsky 1986). This means that any attempt at creating a clear distinction between these two concepts must take into account not only the number of languages involved but also their relationship to each other (i.e., whether they are complementary or contradictory).\n\nA common approach taken when trying to distinguish between multilingualism and plurilingualism involves looking at whether or not all of the languages spoken by a given individual are acquired through formal education or whether some are acquired informally through exposure to them in everyday life (e.g., Grosjean 1982; Skutnabb-Kangas & Phillipson 1994). Another possibility is to look at whether or not an individual is able to function effectively in all of his or her languages or whether one language takes precedence over others depending on the situation (e.g., Kachru 1985).\n\nRegardless of how multilingualism is defined, however, it is generally agreed upon that it differs from bilingualism in that it involves more than just two languages. Bilingualism, on the other hand, typically refers to the ability to use two languages fluently and interchangeably without experiencing any significant interference between them (e.g., Grosjean 1982). Plurilingualism, then, can be seen as a special case of multilingualism wherein an individual is able to function effectively in multiple languages simultaneously without experiencing any significant interference between them (e.g., Grosjean 1982).\n\nNow that we have established what multilingualism and plurilingualism entail, let us now turn our attention towards examining how these concepts relate specifically to electronic lexicography.

            "The aim of this paper is to provide a classification of multilingual and plurilingual electronic lexicographic resources which would enable, on the one hand, the implementation of quantitative and qualitative criteria to produce a typological taxonomy of lexicographical tools, such as dictionaries, as opposed to platforms and websites and, on the other, the distinction of multilingual and plurilingual resources in terms of their larger or lesser prototyping degree. In addition to offering a thorough description of the different resources, this paper also puts forward some parameters and typological proposals to define and demarcate a number of electronic resources, particularly multilingual dictionaries and portals, while also outlining, and even questioning, the object of study of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography.\n\nIn order to do so, we will first look at how multilingualism has been defined over time by various authors before moving on to examine what makes up multilingual electronic lexicography before finally looking at how these two concepts can be combined into one coherent whole. We will then see how this new definition can be applied specifically within the context of plurilingual electronic lexicography. Finally, we will explore ways in which this new definition could potentially impact future research within the field of plurilingual electronic lexicography.\n\nIt should be noted that although there is no universal agreement amongst scholars regarding exactly what constitutes multilingualism or plurilingualism, most agree that both terms refer to more than just two languages being used simultaneously (e.g., Spolsky 1986). This means that any attempt at creating a clear distinction between these two concepts must take into account not only the number of languages involved but also their relationship to each other (i.e., whether they are complementary or contradictory).\n\nA common approach taken when trying to distinguish between multilingualism and plurilingualism involves looking at whether or not all of the languages spoken by a given individual are acquired through formal education or whether some are acquired informally through exposure to them in everyday life (e.g., Grosjean 1982; Skutnabb-Kangas & Phillipson 1994). Another possibility is to look at whether or not an individual is able to function effectively in all of his or her languages or whether one language takes precedence over others depending on the situation (e.g., Kachru 1985).\n\nRegardless of how multilingualism is defined, however, it is generally agreed upon that it differs from bilingualism in that it involves more than just two languages. Bilingualism, on the other hand, typically refers to the ability to use two languages fluently and interchangeably without experiencing any significant interference between them (e.g., Grosjean 1982). Plurilingualism, then, can be seen as a special case of multilingualism wherein an individual is able to function effectively in multiple languages simultaneously without experiencing any significant interference between them (e.g., Grosjean 1982).\n\nNow that we have established what multilingualism and plurilingualism entail, let us now turn our attention towards examining how these concepts relate specifically to electronic lexicography.

In addition to offering a thorough description of the different resources, this paper also puts forward some parameters and typological proposals to define and demarcate a number of electronic resources, particularly multilingual dictionaries and portals, while also outlining, and even questioning, the object of study of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography.\n\nIn order to do so, we will first look at how multilingualism has been defined over time by various authors before moving on to examine what makes up multilingual electronic lexicography before finally looking at how these two concepts can be combined into one coherent whole. We will then see how this new definition can be applied specifically within the context of plurilingual electronic lexicography. Finally, we will explore ways in which this new definition could potentially impact future research within the field of plurilingual electronic lexicography.\n\nIt should be noted that although there is no universal agreement amongst scholars regarding exactly what constitutes multilingualism or plurilingualism, most agree that both terms refer to more than just two languages being used simultaneously (e.g., Spolsky 1986). This means that any attempt at creating a clear distinction between these two concepts must take into account not only the number of languages involved but also their relationship to each other (i.e., whether they are complementary or contradictory).\n\nA common approach taken when trying to distinguish between multilingualism and plurilingualism involves looking at whether or not all of the languages spoken by a given individual are acquired through formal education or whether some are acquired informally through exposure to them in everyday life (e.g., Grosjean 1982; Skutnabb-Kangas & Phillipson 1994). Another possibility is to look at whether or not an individual is able to function effectively in all of his or her languages or whether one language takes precedence over others depending on the situation (e.g., Kachru 1985).\n\nRegardless of how multilingualism is defined, however, it is generally agreed upon that it differs from bilingualism in that it involves more than just two languages. Bilingualism, on the other hand, typically refers to the ability to use two languages fluently and interchangeably without experiencing any significant interference between them (e.g., Grosjean 1982). Plurilingualism, then, can be seen as a special case of multilingualism wherein an individual is able to function effectively in multiple languages simultaneously without experiencing any significant interference between them (e.g., Grosjean 1982).\n\nNow that we have established what multilingualism and plurilingualism entail, let us now turn our attention towards examining how these concepts relate specifically to electronic lexicography. As we will see below, there are several different types of electronic lexicography which can be classified according to their degree of multilingualism or plurilingualism. These include monolingual electronic dictionaries, bilingual electronic dictionaries, multilingual electronic dictionaries, plurilingual electronic dictionaries, monolingual online dictionaries, bilingual online dictionaries, multilingual online dictionaries, plurilingual online dictionaries, monolingual software applications, bilingual software applications, multilingual software applications, plurilingual software applications, monolingual websites, bilingual websites, multilingual websites, plurilingual websites, monolingual corpora, bilingual corpora, multilingual corpora, plurilingual corpora, monolingual databases, bilingual databases, multilingual databases, plurilingual databases, monolingual archives, bilingual archives, multilingual archives, plurilingual archives, monolingual libraries, bilingual libraries, multilingual libraries, plurilingual libraries, monolingual platforms, bilingual platforms, multilingual platforms, plurilingual platforms, monolingual portals, bilingual portals, multilingual portals, plurilingual portals, monolingual systems, bilingual systems, multilingual systems, plurilingual systems, monolingual tools, bilingual tools, multilingual tools, plurilingual tools, monolingual resources, bilingual resources, multilingual resources, plurilingual resources.\n\nIn order to gain a better understanding of how these different types of electronic lexicography differ from each other in terms of their degree of multilingualism or plurilingualism, let us now examine each of them in more detail. Monolingual electronic dictionaries are those that contain entries for only one language (e.g., Merriam-Webster Dictionary Online). Bilingual electronic dictionaries are those that contain entries for two languages (e.g., Oxford English Dictionary Online). Multilingual electronic dictionaries are those that contain entries for three or more languages (e.g., Wiktionary).

Another possibility is to look at whether or not an individual is able to function effectively in all of his or her languages or whether one language takes precedence over others depending on the situation (e.g., Kachru 1985).\n\nRegardless of how multilingualism is defined, however, it is generally agreed upon that it differs from bilingualism in that it involves more than just two languages. Bilingualism, on the other hand, typically refers to the ability to use two languages fluently and interchangeably without experiencing any significant interference between them (e.g., Grosjean 1982). Plurilingualism, then, can be seen as a special case of multilingualism wherein an individual is able to function effectively in multiple languages simultaneously without experiencing any significant interference between them (e.g., Grosjean 1982).\n\nNow that we have established what multilingualism and plurilingualism entail, let us now turn our attention towards examining how these concepts relate specifically to electronic lexicography. As we will see below, there are several different types of electronic lexicography which can be classified according to their degree of multilingualism or plurilingualism.

            "The aim of this paper is to provide a classification of multilingual and plurilingual electronic lexicographic resources which would enable, on the one hand, the implementation of quantitative and qualitative criteria to produce a typological taxonomy of lexicographical tools, such as dictionaries, as opposed to platforms and websites and, on the other, the distinction of multilingual and plurilingual resources in terms of their larger or lesser prototyping degree. In addition to offering a thorough description of the different resources, this paper also puts forward some parameters and typological proposals to define and demarcate a number of electronic resources, particularly multilingual dictionaries and portals, while also outlining, and even questioning, the object of study of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography.\n\nIn order to do so, we will first look at how multilingualism has been defined over time by various authors before moving on to examine what makes up multilingual electronic lexicography before finally looking at how these two concepts can be combined into one coherent whole. We will then see how this new definition can be applied specifically within the context of plurilingual electronic lexicography. Finally, we will explore ways in which this new definition could potentially impact future research within the field of plurilingual electronic lexicography.\n\nIt should be noted that although there is no universal agreement amongst scholars regarding exactly what constitutes multilingualism or plurilingualism, most agree that both terms refer to more than just two languages being used simultaneously (e.g., Spolsky 1986). This means that any attempt at creating a clear distinction between these two concepts must take into account not only the number of languages involved but also their relationship to each other (i.e., whether they are complementary or contradictory).\n\nA common approach taken when trying to distinguish between multilingualism and plurilingualism involves looking at whether or not all of the languages spoken by a given individual are acquired through formal education or whether some are acquired informally through exposure to them in everyday life (e.g., Grosjean 1982; Skutnabb-Kangas & Phillipson 1994). Another possibility is to look at whether or not an individual is able to function effectively in all of his or her languages or whether one language takes precedence over others depending on the situation (e.g., Kachru 1985).\n\nRegardless of how multilingualism is defined, however, it is generally agreed upon that it differs from bilingualism in that it involves more than just two languages.

            "The aim of this paper is to provide a classification of multilingual and plurilingual electronic lexicographic resources which would enable, on the one hand, the implementation of quantitative and qualitative criteria to produce a typological taxonomy of lexicographical tools, such as dictionaries, as opposed to platforms and websites and, on the other, the distinction of multilingual and plurilingual resources in terms of their larger or lesser prototyping degree. In addition to offering a thorough description of the different resources, this paper also puts forward some parameters and typological proposals to define and demarcate a number of electronic resources, particularly multilingual dictionaries and portals, while also outlining, and even questioning, the object of study of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography.\n\nIn order to do so, we will first look at how multilingualism has been defined over time by various authors before moving on to examine what makes up multilingual electronic lexicography before finally looking at how these two concepts can be combined into one coherent whole. We will then see how this new definition can be applied specifically within the context of plurilingual electronic lexicography. Finally, we will explore ways in which this new definition could potentially impact future research within the field of plurilingual electronic lexicography.\n\nIt should be noted that although there is no universal agreement amongst scholars regarding exactly what constitutes multilingualism or plurilingualism, most agree that both terms refer to more than just two languages being used simultaneously (e.g., Spolsky 1986). This means that any attempt at creating a clear distinction between these two concepts must take into account not only the number of languages involved but also their relationship to each other (i.e., whether they are complementary or contradictory).\n\nA common approach taken when trying to distinguish between multilingualism and plurilingualism involves looking at whether or not all of the languages spoken by a given individual are acquired through formal education or whether some are acquired informally through exposure to them in everyday life (e.g., Grosjean 1982; Skutnabb-Kangas & Phillipson 1994). Another possibility is to look at whether or not an individual is able to function effectively in all of his or her languages or whether one language takes precedence over others depending on the situation (e.g., Kachru 1985).\n\nRegardless of how multilingualism is defined, however, it is generally agreed upon that it differs from bilingualism in that it involves more than just two languages. Bilingualism, on the other hand, typically refers to the ability to use two languages fluently and interchangeably without experiencing any significant interference between them (e.g., Grosjean 1982). Plurilingualism, then, can be seen as a special case of multilingualism wherein an individual is able to function effectively in multiple languages simultaneously without experiencing any significant interference between them (e.g., Grosjean 1982).\n\nNow that we have established what multilingualism and plurilingualism entail, let us now turn our attention towards examining how these concepts relate specifically to electronic lexicography.

            "The aim of this paper is to provide a classification of multilingual and plurilingual electronic lexicographic resources which would enable, on the one hand, the implementation of quantitative and qualitative criteria to produce a typological taxonomy of lexicographical tools, such as dictionaries, as opposed to platforms and websites and, on the other, the distinction of multilingual and plurilingual resources in terms of their larger or lesser prototyping degree. In addition to offering a thorough description of the different resources, this paper also puts forward some parameters and typological proposals to define and demarcate a number of electronic resources, particularly multilingual dictionaries and portals, while also outlining, and even questioning, the object of study of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography.\n\nIn order to do so, we will first look at how multilingualism has been defined over time by various authors before moving on to examine what makes up multilingual electronic lexicography before finally looking at how these two concepts can be combined into one coherent whole. We will then see how this new definition can be applied specifically within the context of plurilingual electronic lexicography. Finally, we will explore ways in which this new definition could potentially impact future research within the field of plurilingual electronic lexicography.\n\nIt should be noted that although there is no universal agreement amongst scholars regarding exactly what constitutes multilingualism or plurilingualism, most agree that both terms refer to more than just two languages being used simultaneously (e.g., Spolsky 1986). This means that any attempt at creating a clear distinction between these two concepts must take into account not only the number of languages involved but also their relationship to each other (i.e., whether they are complementary or contradictory).\n\nA common approach taken when trying to distinguish between multilingualism and plurilingualism involves looking at whether or not all of the languages spoken by a given individual are acquired through formal education or whether some are acquired informally through exposure to them in everyday life (e.g., Grosjean 1982; Skutnabb-Kangas & Phillipson 1994). Another possibility is to look at whether or not an individual is able to function effectively in all of his or her languages or whether one language takes precedence over others depending on the situation (e.g., Kachru 1985).\n\nRegardless of how multilingualism is defined, however, it is generally agreed upon that it differs from bilingualism in that it involves more than just two languages. Bilingualism, on the other hand, typically refers to the ability to use two languages fluently and interchangeably without experiencing any significant interference between them (e.g., Grosjean 1982). Plurilingualism, then, can be seen as a special case of multilingualism wherein an individual is able to function effectively in multiple languages simultaneously without experiencing any significant interference between them (e.g., Grosjean 1982).\n\nNow that we have established what multilingualism and plurilingualism entail, let us now turn our attention towards examining how these concepts relate specifically to electronic lexicography.

            "The aim of this paper is to provide a classification of multilingual and plurilingual electronic lexicographic resources which would enable, on the one hand, the implementation of quantitative and qualitative criteria to produce a typological taxonomy of lexicographical tools, such as dictionaries, as opposed to platforms and websites and, on the other, the distinction of multilingual and plurilingual resources in terms of their larger or lesser prototyping degree. In addition to offering a thorough description of the different resources, this paper also puts forward some parameters and typological proposals to define and demarcate a number of electronic resources, particularly multilingual dictionaries and portals, while also outlining, and even questioning, the object of study of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography.\n\nIn order to do so, we will first look at how multilingualism has been defined over time by various authors before moving on to examine what makes up multilingual electronic lexicography before finally looking at how these two concepts can be combined into one coherent whole. We will then see how this new definition can be applied specifically within the context of plurilingual electronic lexicography. Finally, we will explore ways in which this new definition could potentially impact future research within the field of plurilingual electronic lexicography.\n\nIt should be noted that although there is no universal agreement amongst scholars regarding exactly what constitutes multilingualism or plurilingualism, most agree that both terms refer to more than just two languages being used simultaneously (e.g., Spolsky 1986). This means that any attempt at creating a clear distinction between these two concepts must take into account not only the number of languages involved but also their relationship to each other (i.e., whether they are complementary or contradictory).\n\nA common approach taken when trying to distinguish between multilingualism and plurilingualism involves looking at whether or not all of the languages spoken by a given individual are acquired through formal education or whether some are acquired informally through exposure to them in everyday life (e.g., Grosjean 1982; Skutnabb-Kangas & Phillipson 1994). Another possibility is to look at whether or not an individual is able to function effectively in all of his or her languages or whether one language takes precedence over others depending on the situation (e.g., Kachru 1985).\n\nRegardless of how multilingualism is defined, however, it is generally agreed upon that it differs from bilingualism in that it involves more than just two languages. Bilingualism, on the other hand, typically refers to the ability to use two languages fluently and interchangeably without experiencing any significant interference between them (e.g., Grosjean 1982). Plurilingualism, then, can be seen as a special case of multilingualism wherein an individual is able to function effectively in multiple languages simultaneously without experiencing any significant interference between them (e.g., Grosjean 1982).\n\nNow that we have established what multilingualism and plurilingualism entail, let us now turn our attention towards examining how these concepts relate specifically to electronic lexicography. As we will see below, there are several different types of electronic lexicography which can be classified according to their degree of multilingualism or plurilingualism. These include monolingual electronic dictionaries, bilingual electronic dictionaries, multilingual electronic dictionaries, plurilingual electronic dictionaries, monolingual online dictionaries, bilingual online dictionaries, multilingual online dictionaries, plurilingual online dictionaries, monolingual software applications, bilingual software applications, multilingual software applications, plurilingual software applications, monolingual websites, bilingual websites, multilingual websites, plurilingual websites, monolingual corpora, bilingual corpora, multilingual corpora, plurilingual corpora, monolingual databases, bilingual databases, multilingual databases, plurilingual databases, monolingual archives, bilingual archives, multilingual archives, plurilingual archives, monolingual libraries, bilingual libraries, multilingual libraries, plurilingual libraries, monolingual platforms, bilingual platforms, multilingual platforms, plurilingual platforms, monolingual portals, bilingual portals, multilingual portals, plurilingual portals, monolingual systems, bilingual systems, multilingual systems, plurilingual systems, monolingual tools, bilingual tools, multilingual tools, plurilingual tools, monolingual resources, bilingual resources, multilingual resources, plurilingual resources.\n\nIn order to gain a better understanding of how these different types of electronic lexicography differ from each other in terms of their degree of multilingualism or plurilingualism, let us now examine each of them in more detail.
