the one hand, the implementation of quantitative and qualitative criteria to produce atypical taxonomy of lexicographical tools, such as dictionaries, as opposed to platforms and websites and, on the other, the distinction of multilingual and plurilingual resources in terms of their larger or lesser prototyping degree. in addition to offering a thorough description of the different resources, this paper also puts forward some parameters and typological proposals to define and demarcate a number of electronic resources, particularly multilingual dictionaries and portals, while also outlining, and even questioning, the object of study of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography. the paper begins by defining the different types of electronic resources in lexicography, distinguishing between those resources that are not yet fully-fledged dictionaries and those that already have this status. this is followed by an in-depth analysis of the various criteria and parameters by which multilingual and plurilingual electronic lexicographic resources may be classified. the paper concludes with a proposal for a typological taxonomy of multilingual and plurilingual electronic

In addition to offering a thorough description of the different resources, this paper also puts forward some parameters and typological proposals to define and demarcate a number of electronic resources, particularly multilingual dictionaries and portals, while also outlining, and even questioning, the object of study of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography. The paper begins by defining the different types of electronic resources in lexicography, distinguishing between those resources that are not yet fully-fledged dictionaries and those that already have this status. This is followed by an in-depth analysis of the various criteria and parameters by which multilingual and plurilingual electronic lexicographic resources may be classified.

The aim of this paper is to provide a classification of multilingual and plurilingual electronic lexicographic resources which would enable, one the one hand, the implementation of quantitative and qualitative criteria to produce atypical taxonomy of lexicographical tools, such as dictionaries, as opposed to platforms and websites and, on the other, the distinction of multilingual and plurilingual resources in terms of their larger or lesser prototyping degree. In addition to offering a thorough description of the different resources, this paper also puts forward some parameters and typological proposals to define and demarcate a number of electronic resources, particularly multilingual dictionaries and portals, while also outlining, and even questioning, the object of study of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography. The paper begins by defining the different types of electronic resources in lexicography, distinguishing between those resources that are not yet fully-fledged dictionaries and those that already have this status.

The paper concludes with a proposal for a typological taxonomy of multilingual and plurilingual electronic lexicographic resources, and provides a description of the most salient features of each type. The aim of this paper is to provide a classification of multilingual and plurilingual electronic lexicographic resources which would enable, one the one hand, the implementation of quantitative and qualitative criteria to produce atypical taxonomy of lexicographical tools, such as dictionaries, as opposed to platforms and websites and, on the other, the distinction of multilingual and plurilingual resources in terms of their larger or lesser prototyping degree. In addition to offering a thorough description of the different resources, this paper also puts forward some parameters and typological proposals to define and demarcate a number of electronic resources, particularly multilingual dictionaries and portals, while also outlining, and even questioning, the object of study of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography.

The paper begins by defining the different types of electronic resources in lexicography, distinguishing between those resources that are not yet fully-fledged dictionaries and those that already have this status. This is followed by an in-depth analysis of the various criteria and parameters by which multilingual and plurilingual electronic lexicographic resources may be classified. The paper concludes with a proposal for a typological taxonomy of multilingual and plurilingual electronic lexicographic resources, and provides a description of the most salient features of each type.

The aim of this paper is to provide a classification of multilingual and plurilingual electronic lexicographic resources which would enable, one the one hand, the implementation of quantitative and qualitative criteria to produce atypical taxonomy of lexicographical tools, such as dictionaries, as opposed to platforms and websites and, on the other, the distinction of multilingual and plurilingual resources in terms of their larger or lesser prototyping degree. In addition to offering a thorough description of the different resources, this paper also puts forward some parameters and typological proposals to define and demarcate a number of electronic resources, particularly multilingual dictionaries and portals, while also outlining, and even questioning, the object of study of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography. The paper begins by defining the different types of electronic resources in lexicography, distinguishing between those resources that are not yet fully-fledged dictionaries and those that already have this status.

The paper concludes with a proposal for a typological taxonomy of multilingual and plurilingual electronic lexicographic resources, and provides a description of the most salient features of each type. The aim of this paper is to provide a classification of multilingual and plurilingual electronic lexicographic resources which would enable, one the one hand, the implementation of quantitative and qualitative criteria to produce atypical taxonomy of lexicographical tools, such as dictionaries, as opposed to platforms and websites and, on the other, the distinction of multilingual and plurilingual resources in terms of their larger or lesser prototyping degree. In addition to offering a thorough description of the different resources, this paper also puts forward some parameters and typological proposals to define and demarcate a number of electronic resources, particularly multilingual dictionaries and portals, while also outlining, and even questioning, the object of study of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography.

The paper begins by defining the different types of electronic resources in lexicography, distinguishing between those resources that are not yet fully-fledged dictionaries and those that already have this status. This is followed by an in-depth analysis of the various criteria and parameters by which multilingual and plurilingual electronic lexicographic resources may be classified. The paper concludes with a proposal for a typological taxonomy of multilingual and plurilingual electronic lexicographic resources, and provides a description of the most salient features of each type.

The paper concludes with a proposal for a typological taxonomy of multilingual and plurilingual electronic lexicographic resources, and provides a description of the most salient features of each type. The aim of this paper is to provide a classification of multilingual and plurilingual electronic lexicographic resources which would enable, on one hand, the implementation of quantitative and qualitative criteria to produce an atypical taxonomy of lexicographical tools, such as dictionaries, as opposed to platforms and websites, and on the other, the distinction of multilingual and plurilingual resources in terms of their larger or lesser prototyping degree. In addition to offering a thorough description of the different resources, this paper also puts forward some parameters and typological proposals to define and demarcate a number of electronic resources, particularly multilingual dictionaries and portals, while also outlining, and even questioning, the object of study of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography.

The paper begins by defining the different types of electronic resources in lexicography, distinguishing between those resources that are not yet fully-fledged dictionaries and those that already have this status. This is followed by an in-depth analysis of the various criteria and parameters by which multilingual and plurilingual electronic lexicographic resources may be classified. The paper concludes with a proposal for a typological taxonomy of multilingual and plurilingual electronic lexicographic resources, and provides a description of the most salient features of each type.

The aim of this paper is to provide a classification of multilingual and plurilingual electronic lexicographic resources which would enable, on one hand, the implementation of quantitative and qualitative criteria to produce an atypical taxonomy of lexicographical tools, such as dictionaries, as opposed to platforms and websites, and on the other, the distinction of multilingual and plurilingual resources in terms of their larger or lesser prototyping degree. In addition to offering a thorough description of the different resources, this paper also puts forward some parameters and typological proposals to define and demarcate a number of electronic resources, particularly multilingual dictionaries and portals, while also outlining, and even questioning, the object of study of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography. The paper begins by defining the different types of electronic resources in lexicography, distinguishing between those resources that are not yet fully-fledged dictionaries and those that already have this status.

The paper concludes with a proposal for a typological taxonomy of multilingual and plurilingual electronic lexicographic resources, and provides a description of the most salient features of each type. The aim of this paper is to provide a classification of multilingual and plurilingual electronic lexicographic resources which would enable, on one hand, the implementation of quantitative and qualitative criteria to produce an atypical taxonomy of lexicographical tools, such as dictionaries, as opposed to platforms and websites, and on the other, the distinction of multilingual and plurilingual resources in terms of their larger or lesser prototyping degree. In addition to offering a thorough description of the different resources, this paper also puts forward some parameters and typological proposals to define and demarcate a number of electronic resources, particularly multilingual dictionaries and portals, while also outlining, and even questioning, the object of study of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography.

The paper begins by defining the different types of electronic resources in lexicography, distinguishing between those resources that are not yet fully-fledged dictionaries and those that already have this status. This is followed by an in-depth analysis of the various criteria and parameters by which multilingual and plurilingual electronic lexicographic resources may be classified. The paper concludes with a proposal for a typological taxonomy of multilingual and plurilingual electronic lexicographic resources, and provides a description of the most salient features of each type.

The aim of this paper is to provide a classification of multilingual and plurilingual electronic lexicographic resources which would enable, on one hand, the implementation of quantitative and qualitative criteria to produce an atypical taxonomy of lexicographical tools, such as dictionaries, as opposed to platforms and websites, and on the other, the distinction of multilingual and plurilingual resources in terms of their larger or lesser prototyping degree. In addition to offering a thorough description of the different resources, this paper also puts forward some parameters and typological proposals to define and demarcate a number of electronic resources, particularly multilingual dictionaries and portals, while also outlining, and even questioning, the object of study of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography. The paper begins by defining the different types of electronic resources in lexicography, distinguishing between those resources that are not yet fully-fledged dictionaries and those that already have this status.

The paper concludes with a proposal for a typological taxonomy of multilingual and plurilingual electronic lexicographic resources, and provides a description of the most salient features of each type. The aim of this paper is to provide a classification of multilingual and plurilingual electronic lexicographic resources which would enable, on one hand, the implementation of quantitative and qualitative criteria to produce an atypical taxonomy of lexicographical tools, such as dictionaries, as opposed to platforms and websites, and on the other, the distinction of multilingual and plurilingual resources in terms of their larger or lesser prototyping degree. In addition to offering a thorough description of the different resources, this paper also puts forward some parameters and typological proposals to define and demarcate a number of electronic resources, particularly multilingual dictionaries and portals, while also outlining, and even questioning, the object of study of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography.

The paper begins by defining the different types of electronic resources in lexicography, distinguishing between those resources that are not yet fully-fledged dictionaries and those that already have this status. This is followed by an in-depth analysis of the various criteria and parameters by which multilingual and plurilingual electronic lexicographic resources may be classified. The paper concludes with a proposal for a typological taxonomy of multilingual and plurilingual electronic lexicographic resources, and provides a description of the most salient features of each type.

The aim of this paper is to provide a classification of multilingual and plurilingual electronic lexicographic resources which would enable, on one hand, the implementation of quantitative and qualitative criteria to produce an atypical taxonomy of lexicographical tools, such as dictionaries, as opposed to platforms and websites, and on the other, the distinction of multilingual and plurilingual resources in terms of their larger or lesser prototyping degree. In addition to offering a thorough description of the different resources, this paper also puts forward some parameters and typological proposals to define and demarcate a number of electronic resources, particularly multilingual dictionaries and portals, while also outlining, and even questioning, the object of study of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography. The paper begins by defining the different types of electronic resources in lexicography, distinguishing between those resources that are not yet fully-fledged dictionaries and those that already have this status.

The paper begins by defining the different types of electronic resources in lexicography, distinguishing between those resources that are not yet fully-fledged dictionaries and those that already have this status. This is followed by an in-depth analysis of the various criteria and parameters by which multilingual and plurilingual electronic lexicographic resources may be classified. The paper concludes with a proposal for a typological taxonomy of multilingual and plurilingual electronic lexicographic resources, and provides a description of the most salient features of each type.

The paper concludes with a proposal for a typological taxonomy of multilingual and plurilingual electronic lexicographic resources, and provides a description of the most salient features of each type. The aim of this paper is to provide a classification of multilingual and plurilingual electronic lexicographic resources which would enable, on one hand, the implementation of quantitative and qualitative criteria to produce an atypical taxonomy of lexicographical tools, such as dictionaries, as opposed to platforms and websites, and on the other, the distinction of multilingual and plurilingual resources in terms of their larger or lesser prototyping degree. In addition to offering a thorough description of the different resources, this paper also puts forward some parameters and typological proposals to define and demarcate a number of electronic resources, particularly multilingual dictionaries and portals, while also outlining, and even questioning, the object of study of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography.
