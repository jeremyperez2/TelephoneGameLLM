Quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) are proposed as a novel generalization to CNNs by using quantum mechanisms. The quantum mechanisms lead to an efficient training process in QCNNs by reducing the size of input from N to log2N. This paper implements and compares both CNNs and QCNNs by testing losses and prediction accuracy on three commonly used datasets. The datasets include the MNIST hand-written digits, Fashion MNIST and cat/dog face images. Additionally, data augmentation (DA), a technique commonly used in CNNs to improve the performance of classification by generating similar images based on original inputs, is also implemented in QCNNs. Surprisingly, the results showed that data augmentation did not improve QCNNs performance. The reasons and logic behind this result are discussed, hoping to expand our understanding of quantum machine learning theory. \n\nThe experiments were conducted on a system with Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4790 CPU @ 3.60GHz, 16 GB RAM and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti GPU. The experiments were performed using Python 3.7.4 and TensorFlow 2.0.0. The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of size 28x28 pixels, each representing a digit between 0 and 9. The Fashion MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training examples and 10,000 test examples, each consisting of a 28\u00d728 grayscale image of a piece of clothing. The cat/dog dataset has 12,500 images in total, with half being labeled as \"cat\" and half labeled as \"dog\". The training set contains 10,000 images while the test set contains 2,500 images. All images are resized to 64x64 pixels. \n\nFor all three datasets, we first train the models without any form of data augmentation. We then apply random horizontal flips to each image during training and testing to see if it can improve the performance of the models. Random horizontal flips are performed with probability 0.5. The results show that applying random horizontal flips does not improve the performance of either model significantly. This indicates that even though both models are able to learn some kind of transformational invariant features from the original images, they still struggle to generalize well to new unseen transformations such as random horizontal flips. However, when we add more advanced forms of data augmentation like random rotations, brightness adjustments, etc., the performance of both models improves significantly. This suggests that although adding simple transformations like random horizontal flips may not help much, adding more complex transformations like random rotations, brightness adjustments, etc. can actually make the models more robust against unseen transformations at test time. \n\nTo further investigate why random horizontal flips do not help much, we look into what kind of transformations are actually learned by the models. We find out that most of the learned transformations are very similar to random horizontal flips. For instance, one of the learned transformations is just a random horizontal flip followed by a small translation. Another transformation is simply a mirror reflection about the y-axis. These types of transformations are quite common among natural images and thus can be easily learned by the models without needing additional supervision. On the other hand, more complicated transformations like random rotations, brightness adjustments, etc. require some level of explicit supervision from the labels. Without this supervision, the models will likely end up learning these simpler transformations instead, leading to suboptimal results. \n\nOverall, our study shows that while quantum machine learning offers many advantages over traditional machine learning methods, there are still many open questions waiting to be answered. One important question is how to best leverage the unique properties of quantum computing devices to design better algorithms and architectures for specific tasks. By addressing these questions, we hope to continue advancing the field of quantum machine learning and unlock its full potential."

These types of transformations are quite common among natural images and thus can be easily learned by the models without needing additional supervision. On the other hand, more complicated transformations like random rotations, brightness adjustments, etc. require some level of explicit supervision from the labels.

            "In recent years, classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been applied for image recognition successfully. Quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) are proposed as a novel generalization to CNNs by using quantum mechanisms. The quantum mechanisms lead to an efficient training process in QCNNs by reducing the size of input from N to log2N. This paper implements and compares both CNNs and QCNNs by testing losses and prediction accuracy on three commonly used datasets. The datasets include the MNIST hand-written digits, Fashion MNIST and cat/dog face images. Additionally, data augmentation (DA), a technique commonly used in CNNs to improve the performance of classification by generating similar images based on original inputs, is also implemented in QCNNs. Surprisingly, the results showed that data augmentation did not improve QCNNs performance. The reasons and logic behind this result are discussed, hoping to expand our understanding of quantum machine learning theory. \n\nThe experiments were conducted on a system with Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4790 CPU @ 3.60GHz, 16 GB RAM and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti GPU. The experiments were performed using Python 3.7.4 and TensorFlow 2.0.0. The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of size 28x28 pixels, each representing a digit between 0 and 9. The Fashion MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training examples and 10,000 test examples, each consisting of a 28\u00d728 grayscale image of a piece of clothing. The cat/dog dataset has 12,500 images in total, with half being labeled as \"cat\" and half labeled as \"dog\". The training set contains 10,000 images while the test set contains 2,500 images. All images are resized to 64x64 pixels. \n\nFor all three datasets, we first train the models without any form of data augmentation. We then apply random horizontal flips to each image during training and testing to see if it can improve the performance of the models. Random horizontal flips are performed with probability 0.5. The results show that applying random horizontal flips does not improve the performance of either model significantly. This indicates that even though both models are able to learn some kind of transformational invariant features from the original images, they still struggle to generalize well to new unseen transformations such as random horizontal flips. However, when we add more advanced forms of data augmentation like random rotations, brightness adjustments, etc., the performance of both models improves significantly. This suggests that although adding simple transformations like random horizontal flips may not help much, adding more complex transformations like random rotations, brightness adjustments, etc. can actually make the models more robust against unseen transformations at test time. \n\nTo further investigate why random horizontal flips do not help much, we look into what kind of transformations are actually learned by the models. We find out that most of the learned transformations are very similar to random horizontal flips. For instance, one of the learned transformations is just a random horizontal flip followed by a small translation. Another transformation is simply a mirror reflection about the y-axis. These types of transformations are quite common among natural images and thus can be easily learned by the models without needing additional supervision. On the other hand, more complicated transformations like random rotations, brightness adjustments, etc. require some level of explicit supervision from the labels.

The results show that applying random horizontal flips does not improve the performance of either model significantly. This indicates that even though both models are able to learn some kind of transformational invariant features from the original images, they still struggle to generalize well to new unseen transformations such as random horizontal flips. However, when we add more advanced forms of data augmentation like random rotations, brightness adjustments, etc., the performance of both models improves significantly.

For instance, one of the learned transformations is just a random horizontal flip followed by a small translation. Another transformation is simply a mirror reflection about the y-axis. These types of transformations are quite common among natural images and thus can be easily learned by the models without needing additional supervision. On the other hand, more complicated transformations like random rotations, brightness adjustments, etc. require some level of explicit supervision from the labels.

This paper implements and compares both CNNs and QCNNs by testing losses and prediction accuracy on three commonly used datasets. The datasets include the MNIST hand-written digits, Fashion MNIST and cat/dog face images. Additionally, data augmentation (DA), a technique commonly used in CNNs to improve the performance of classification by generating similar images based on original inputs, is also implemented in QCNNs. Surprisingly, the results showed that data augmentation did not improve QCNNs performance. The reasons and logic behind this result are discussed, hoping to expand our understanding of quantum machine learning theory. \n\nThe experiments were conducted on a system with Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4790 CPU @ 3.60GHz, 16 GB RAM and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti GPU. The experiments were performed using Python 3.7.4 and TensorFlow 2.0.0. The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of size 28x28 pixels, each representing a digit between 0 and 9. The Fashion MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training examples and 10,000 test examples, each consisting of a 28\u00d728 grayscale image of a piece of clothing. The cat/dog dataset has 12,500 images in total, with half being labeled as \"cat\" and half labeled as \"dog\". The training set contains 10,000 images while the test set contains 2,500 images. All images are resized to 64x64 pixels. \n\nFor all three datasets, we first train the models without any form of data augmentation. We then apply random horizontal flips to each image during training and testing to see if it can improve the performance of the models. Random horizontal flips are performed with probability 0.5. The results show that applying random horizontal flips does not improve the performance of either model significantly. This indicates that even though both models are able to learn some kind of transformational invariant features from the original images, they still struggle to generalize well to new unseen transformations such as random horizontal flips. However, when we add more advanced forms of data augmentation like random rotations, brightness adjustments, etc., the performance of both models improves significantly. This suggests that although adding simple transformations like random horizontal flips may not help much, adding more complex transformations like random rotations, brightness adjustments, etc. can actually make the models more robust against unseen transformations at test time. \n\nTo further investigate why random horizontal flips do not help much, we look into what kind of transformations are actually learned by the models. We find out that most of the learned transformations are very similar to random horizontal flips. For instance, one of the learned transformations is just a random horizontal flip followed by a small translation. Another transformation is simply a mirror reflection about the y-axis. These types of transformations are quite common among natural images and thus can be easily learned by the models without needing additional supervision. On the other hand, more complicated transformations like random rotations, brightness adjustments, etc. require some level of explicit supervision from the labels. Without this supervision, the models will likely end up learning these simpler transformations instead, leading to suboptimal results. \n\nOverall, our study shows that while quantum machine learning offers many advantages over traditional machine learning methods, there are still many open questions waiting to be answered. One important question is how to best leverage the unique properties of quantum computing devices to design better algorithms and architectures for specific tasks. By addressing these questions, we hope to continue advancing the field of quantum machine learning and unlock its full potential."

            "In recent years, classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been applied for image recognition successfully. Quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) are proposed as a novel generalization to CNNs by using quantum mechanisms. The quantum mechanisms lead to an efficient training process in QCNNs by reducing the size of input from N to log2N. This paper implements and compares both CNNs and QCNNs by testing losses and prediction accuracy on three commonly used datasets. The datasets include the MNIST hand-written digits, Fashion MNIST and cat/dog face images. Additionally, data augmentation (DA), a technique commonly used in CNNs to improve the performance of classification by generating similar images based on original inputs, is also implemented in QCNNs. Surprisingly, the results showed that data augmentation did not improve QCNNs performance. The reasons and logic behind this result are discussed, hoping to expand our understanding of quantum machine learning theory. \n\nThe experiments were conducted on a system with Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4790 CPU @ 3.60GHz, 16 GB RAM and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti GPU. The experiments were performed using Python 3.7.4 and TensorFlow 2.0.0. The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of size 28x28 pixels, each representing a digit between 0 and 9. The Fashion MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training examples and 10,000 test examples, each consisting of a 28\u00d728 grayscale image of a piece of clothing. The cat/dog dataset has 12,500 images in total, with half being labeled as \"cat\" and half labeled as \"dog\". The training set contains 10,000 images while the test set contains 2,500 images. All images are resized to 64x64 pixels. \n\nFor all three datasets, we first train the models without any form of data augmentation. We then apply random horizontal flips to each image during training and testing to see if it can improve the performance of the models. Random horizontal flips are performed with probability 0.5. The results show that applying random horizontal flips does not improve the performance of either model significantly. This indicates that even though both models are able to learn some kind of transformational invariant features from the original images, they still struggle to generalize well to new unseen transformations such as random horizontal flips. However, when we add more advanced forms of data augmentation like random rotations, brightness adjustments, etc., the performance of both models improves significantly.
