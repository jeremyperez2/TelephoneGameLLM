            "In recent years, classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been applied for image recognition successfully. Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs) are proposed as a novel generalization to CNNs by using quantum mechanisms. The quantum mechanisms lead to an efficient training process in QCNNs by reducing the size of input from n to log2n. This paper implements and compares both CNNs and QCNNs by testing losses and prediction accuracy on three commonly used datasets.
