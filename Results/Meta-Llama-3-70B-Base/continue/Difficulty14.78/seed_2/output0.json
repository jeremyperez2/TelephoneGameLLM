Quantum mechanics is a difficult field to master, and even the most experienced quantum physicists often struggle to understand the nuances of the subject.

If the training data is not sufficiently diverse, the neural network will not be able to learn effectively, and as a result, it will not be able to improve its performance through data augmentation.\n\nFinally, it is also possible that the QCNNs were simply not designed well enough.

            "In recent years, classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been applied for image recognition successfully. Quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) are proposed as a novel generalization to CNNs by using quantum mechanisms. The quantum mechanisms lead to an efficient training process in QCNNs by reducing the size of input from $n$ to $log_2n$. This paper implements and compares both CNNs and QCNNs by testing losses and prediction accuracy on three commonly used datasets. The datasets include the MNIST hand-written digits, Fashion MNIST and Cat/Dog face images. Additionally, data augmentation (DA), a technique commonly used in CNNs to improve the performance of classification by generating similar images based on original inputs, is also implemented in QCNNs. Surprisingly, the results showed that data augmentation did not improve QCNNs performance. The reasons and logic behind this result are discussed, hoping to expand our understanding of quantum machine learning theory.\n\nOne possible reason is that quantum computing requires a more specialized understanding than classical computing.

            "In recent years, classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been applied for image recognition successfully. Quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) are proposed as a novel generalization to CNNs by using quantum mechanisms. The quantum mechanisms lead to an efficient training process in QCNNs by reducing the size of input from $n$ to $log_2n$. This paper implements and compares both CNNs and QCNNs by testing losses and prediction accuracy on three commonly used datasets. The datasets include the MNIST hand-written digits, Fashion MNIST and Cat/Dog face images. Additionally, data augmentation (DA), a technique commonly used in CNNs to improve the performance of classification by generating similar images based on original inputs, is also implemented in QCNNs. Surprisingly, the results showed that data augmentation did not improve QCNNs performance. The reasons and logic behind this result are discussed, hoping to expand our understanding of quantum machine learning theory.\n\nOne possible reason is that quantum computing requires a more specialized understanding than classical computing. Quantum mechanics is a difficult field to master, and even the most experienced quantum physicists often struggle to understand the nuances of the subject. As a result, it is likely that the researchers who developed the QCNNs did not fully understand the implications of their design choices, and as a result, they did not take full advantage of the quantum computing capabilities.\n\nAnother possible reason is that the training data used for the QCNNs was not sufficiently diverse.

If the training data is not sufficiently diverse, the neural network will not be able to learn effectively, and as a result, it will not be able to improve its performance through data augmentation.\n\nFinally, it is also possible that the QCNNs were simply not designed well enough. Neural networks are complex systems, and even small changes to their design can have a significant impact on their performance. It is possible that the QCNNs were not designed well enough to take full advantage of the quantum computing capabilities, and as a result, they were not able to improve their performance through data augmentation.\n\nIn any case, the results of this study are surprising and warrant further investigation.
