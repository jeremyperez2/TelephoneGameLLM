And it seems that cheating is actually quite common in the game.\n\nSo, what does this all mean? Well, it's hard to say for sure. But it seems that cheating is a big problem in Xiangqi. And it's something that the authorities need to take seriously. Because, if cheating is allowed to continue, it could seriously damage the integrity of the game. And that would be a shame, because Xiangqi is a great game. It's a game that is enjoyed by millions of people around the world. And it would be a shame if it was ruined by cheating."

            "The winner of a Xiangqi, or Chinese chess, tournament has been stripped of his title after allegations of inappropriate behaviour.\n\nYan Chenglong has also been accused of cheating by using a communication device analogous to anal beads.\n\nThe 48-year-old has been stripped of his title and banned from playing for a year.\n\nHowever, the Chinese Xiangqi Association (CXA) says it's impossible to prove accusations of cheating.\n\nXiangqi has been hugely popular across Asia for hundreds of years.\n\nAccording to the CXA, Mr Yan started drinking with friends in his hotel room shortly after winning the title of \"Xiangqi King\" at a national tournament held on the Chinese island of Hainan last week.\n\nHe then defecated in the hotel bath in an act \"that damaged hotel property and violated public order and good morals\", said the CXA statement.\n\nThe CXA was forced to address rumours circulating online that Mr Yan had cheated using anal beads equipped with wireless transmitters to send and receive signals.\n\n\"Based on our understanding of the situation, it is currently impossible to prove that Yan engaged in cheating via 'anal beads' as speculated on social media,\" the CXA said.\n\nAs punishment for bad behaviour, Mr Yan was stripped of his title and banned from playing for a year.\n\nThe association did not disclose the amount of prize money Yan was forfeiting, but Xiangqi tournaments often promise winners tens of thousands of yuan (thousands of dollars), according to AFP.\n\nIt's interesting that Yan Chenglong was accused of cheating by using anal beads. How did he do it? Did he really use anal beads? Or was it a misunderstanding? I guess we will never know for sure. But one thing is for sure, Yan Chenglong won't be playing Xiangqi for a while. That's too bad for him, but maybe it's for the best. After all, he did violate public order and good morals. Maybe he will learn his lesson and not do it again. But we can only hope.\n\nThe whole situation is really strange. I mean, who would even think of cheating by using anal beads? It's just so weird. But I guess anything is possible. Maybe Yan Chenglong was just desperate to win. Or maybe he's just a really weird guy. Either way, it's definitely not something you see every day. And it's definitely not something I would ever want to do. But I guess that's just me.\n\nBut the story doesn't end there. In fact, it gets even stranger.

How did he do it? Did he really use anal beads? Or was it a misunderstanding? I guess we will never know for sure. But one thing is for sure, Yan Chenglong won't be playing Xiangqi for a while. That's too bad for him, but maybe it's for the best. After all, he did violate public order and good morals. Maybe he will learn his lesson and not do it again. But we can only hope.\n\nThe whole situation is really strange. I mean, who would even think of cheating by using anal beads? It's just so weird. But I guess anything is possible.

And it turns out, it's not just Yan Chenglong who has been accused of cheating. In fact, there have been several cases of cheating in Xiangqi over the years. And it seems that cheating is actually quite common in the game.\n\nSo, what does this all mean? Well, it's hard to say for sure. But it seems that cheating is a big problem in Xiangqi. And it's something that the authorities need to take seriously. Because, if cheating is allowed to continue, it could seriously damage the integrity of the game. And that would be a shame, because Xiangqi is a great game. It's a game that is enjoyed by millions of people around the world. And it would be a shame if it was ruined by cheating.\n\nThe authorities need to take a closer look at the issue of cheating in Xiangqi. And they need to take steps to prevent it from happening in the future. If they don't, the game could be seriously damaged. And that would be a shame, because Xiangqi is a great game.

            "The winner of a Xiangqi, or Chinese chess, tournament has been stripped of his title after allegations of inappropriate behaviour.\n\nYan Chenglong has also been accused of cheating by using a communication device analogous to anal beads.\n\nThe 48-year-old has been stripped of his title and banned from playing for a year.\n\nHowever, the Chinese Xiangqi Association (CXA) says it's impossible to prove accusations of cheating.\n\nXiangqi has been hugely popular across Asia for hundreds of years.\n\nAccording to the CXA, Mr Yan started drinking with friends in his hotel room shortly after winning the title of \"Xiangqi King\" at a national tournament held on the Chinese island of Hainan last week.\n\nHe then defecated in the hotel bath in an act \"that damaged hotel property and violated public order and good morals\", said the CXA statement.\n\nThe CXA was forced to address rumours circulating online that Mr Yan had cheated using anal beads equipped with wireless transmitters to send and receive signals.\n\n\"Based on our understanding of the situation, it is currently impossible to prove that Yan engaged in cheating via 'anal beads' as speculated on social media,\" the CXA said.\n\nAs punishment for bad behaviour, Mr Yan was stripped of his title and banned from playing for a year.\n\nThe association did not disclose the amount of prize money Yan was forfeiting, but Xiangqi tournaments often promise winners tens of thousands of yuan (thousands of dollars), according to AFP.\n\nIt's interesting that Yan Chenglong was accused of cheating by using anal beads. How did he do it? Did he really use anal beads? Or was it a misunderstanding? I guess we will never know for sure. But one thing is for sure, Yan Chenglong won't be playing Xiangqi for a while. That's too bad for him, but maybe it's for the best. After all, he did violate public order and good morals. Maybe he will learn his lesson and not do it again. But we can only hope.\n\nThe whole situation is really strange. I mean, who would even think of cheating by using anal beads? It's just so weird. But I guess anything is possible. Maybe Yan Chenglong was just desperate to win. Or maybe he's just a really weird guy. Either way, it's definitely not something you see every day. And it's definitely not something I would ever want to do. But I guess that's just me.\n\nBut the story doesn't end there. In fact, it gets even stranger.

How did he do it? Did he really use anal beads? Or was it a misunderstanding? I guess we will never know for sure. But one thing is for sure, Yan Chenglong won't be playing Xiangqi for a while. That's too bad for him, but maybe it's for the best. After all, he did violate public order and good morals. Maybe he will learn his lesson and not do it again. But we can only hope.\n\nThe whole situation is really strange. I mean, who would even think of cheating by using anal beads? It's just so weird. But I guess anything is possible.

And it turns out, it's not just Yan Chenglong who has been accused of cheating. In fact, there have been several cases of cheating in Xiangqi over the years. And it seems that cheating is actually quite common in the game.\n\nSo, what does this all mean? Well, it's hard to say for sure. But it seems that cheating is a big problem in Xiangqi. And it's something that the authorities need to take seriously. Because, if cheating is allowed to continue, it could seriously damage the integrity of the game. And that would be a shame, because Xiangqi is a great game. It's a game that is enjoyed by millions of people around the world. And it would be a shame if it was ruined by cheating.\n\nThe authorities need to take a closer look at the issue of cheating in Xiangqi. And they need to take steps to prevent it from happening in the future. If they don't, the game could be seriously damaged. And that would be a shame, because Xiangqi is a great game.

            "The winner of a Xiangqi, or Chinese chess, tournament has been stripped of his title after allegations of inappropriate behaviour.\n\nYan Chenglong has also been accused of cheating by using a communication device analogous to anal beads.\n\nThe 48-year-old has been stripped of his title and banned from playing for a year.\n\nHowever, the Chinese Xiangqi Association (CXA) says it's impossible to prove accusations of cheating.\n\nXiangqi has been hugely popular across Asia for hundreds of years.\n\nAccording to the CXA, Mr Yan started drinking with friends in his hotel room shortly after winning the title of \"Xiangqi King\" at a national tournament held on the Chinese island of Hainan last week.\n\nHe then defecated in the hotel bath in an act \"that damaged hotel property and violated public order and good morals\", said the CXA statement.\n\nThe CXA was forced to address rumours circulating online that Mr Yan had cheated using anal beads equipped with wireless transmitters to send and receive signals.\n\n\"Based on our understanding of the situation, it is currently impossible to prove that Yan engaged in cheating via 'anal beads' as speculated on social media,\" the CXA said.\n\nAs punishment for bad behaviour, Mr Yan was stripped of his title and banned from playing for a year.\n\nThe association did not disclose the amount of prize money Yan was forfeiting, but Xiangqi tournaments often promise winners tens of thousands of yuan (thousands of dollars), according to AFP.\n\nIt's interesting that Yan Chenglong was accused of cheating by using anal beads. How did he do it? Did he really use anal beads? Or was it a misunderstanding? I guess we will never know for sure. But one thing is for sure, Yan Chenglong won't be playing Xiangqi for a while. That's too bad for him, but maybe it's for the best. After all, he did violate public order and good morals. Maybe he will learn his lesson and not do it again. But we can only hope.\n\nThe whole situation is really strange. I mean, who would even think of cheating by using anal beads? It's just so weird. But I guess anything is possible. Maybe Yan Chenglong was just desperate to win. Or maybe he's just a really weird guy. Either way, it's definitely not something you see every day. And it's definitely not something I would ever want to do. But I guess that's just me.\n\nBut the story doesn't end there. In fact, it gets even stranger.
