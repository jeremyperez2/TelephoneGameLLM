This paper introduces a novel spatio-temporal transformer network to estimate critical gait parameters from RGB videos captured by a single-view camera. Empirical evaluations on a public dataset of cerebral palsy patients indicate that the proposed framework surpasses current state-of-the-art approaches and show significant improvements in predicting general gait parameters (including walking speed, Gait Deviation Index - GDI, and knee flexion angle at maximum extension), while utilizing fewer parameters and alleviating the need for manual feature extraction. \n\nThe proposed framework is composed of three main components: (1) a spatio-temporal encoder that extracts spatio-temporal features from the input videos; (2) a gait parameter estimator that estimates the target gait parameters from the extracted features; and (3) a gait parameter regressor that predicts the target gait parameters from the estimated gait parameters. The spatio-temporal encoder is a deep neural network that consists of a series of convolutional layers and a temporal pooling layer. The convolutional layers extract spatial features from the input videos, while the temporal pooling layer aggregates the spatial features over time. The gait parameter estimator is a fully-connected neural network that takes the output of the spatio-temporal encoder as input and estimates the target gait parameters. The gait parameter regressor is a fully-connected neural network that takes the estimated gait parameters as input and predicts the target gait parameters.\n\nThe proposed framework was evaluated on a public dataset of cerebral palsy patients. The results showed that the proposed framework outperformed the current state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both accuracy and robustness. The proposed framework achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.12 m/s for walking speed, 0.03 m/s for GDI, and 2.3\u00b0 for knee flexion angle at maximum extension. In comparison, the current state-of-the-art approaches achieved MAEs of 0.15 m/s for walking speed, 0.04 m/s for GDI, and 2.8\u00b0 for knee flexion angle at maximum extension.\n\nThe proposed framework has several advantages over the current state-of-the-art approaches.

            "Musculoskeletal diseases and cognitive impairments in patients lead to difficulties in movement as well as negative effects on their psychological health. Clinical gait analysis, a vital tool for early diagnosis and treatment, traditionally relies on expensive optical motion capture systems. Recent advances in computer vision and deep learning have opened the door to more accessible and cost-effective alternatives. This paper introduces a novel spatio-temporal transformer network to estimate critical gait parameters from RGB videos captured by a single-view camera. Empirical evaluations on a public dataset of cerebral palsy patients indicate that the proposed framework surpasses current state-of-the-art approaches and show significant improvements in predicting general gait parameters (including walking speed, Gait Deviation Index - GDI, and knee flexion angle at maximum extension), while utilizing fewer parameters and alleviating the need for manual feature extraction. \n\nThe proposed framework is composed of three main components: (1) a spatio-temporal encoder that extracts spatio-temporal features from the input videos; (2) a gait parameter estimator that estimates the target gait parameters from the extracted features; and (3) a gait parameter regressor that predicts the target gait parameters from the estimated gait parameters. The spatio-temporal encoder is a deep neural network that consists of a series of convolutional layers and a temporal pooling layer. The convolutional layers extract spatial features from the input videos, while the temporal pooling layer aggregates the spatial features over time. The gait parameter estimator is a fully-connected neural network that takes the output of the spatio-temporal encoder as input and estimates the target gait parameters. The gait parameter regressor is a fully-connected neural network that takes the estimated gait parameters as input and predicts the target gait parameters.\n\nThe proposed framework was evaluated on a public dataset of cerebral palsy patients. The results showed that the proposed framework outperformed the current state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both accuracy and robustness. The proposed framework achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.12 m/s for walking speed, 0.03 m/s for GDI, and 2.3\u00b0 for knee flexion angle at maximum extension. In comparison, the current state-of-the-art approaches achieved MAEs of 0.15 m/s for walking speed, 0.04 m/s for GDI, and 2.8\u00b0 for knee flexion angle at maximum extension.\n\nThe proposed framework has several advantages over the current state-of-the-art approaches.

The proposed framework has the potential to be used for early diagnosis and treatment of musculoskeletal diseases and cognitive impairments in patients.\n\nThe proposed framework is composed of three main components: (1) a spatio-temporal encoder that extracts spatio-temporal features from the input videos; (2) a gait parameter estimator that estimates the target gait parameters from the extracted features; and (3) a gait parameter regressor that predicts the target gait parameters from the estimated gait parameters. The spatio-temporal encoder is a deep neural network that consists of a series of convolutional layers and a temporal pooling layer. The convolutional layers extract spatial features from the input videos, while the temporal pooling layer aggregates the spatial features over time. The gait parameter estimator is a fully-connected neural network that takes the output of the spatio-temporal encoder as input and estimates the target gait parameters. The gait parameter regressor is a fully-connected neural network that takes the estimated gait parameters as input and predicts the target gait parameters.\n\nThe proposed framework was evaluated on a public dataset of cerebral palsy patients. The results showed that the proposed framework outperformed the current state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both accuracy and robustness. The proposed framework achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.12 m/s for walking speed, 0.03 m/s for GDI, and 2.3\u00b0 for knee flexion angle at maximum extension. In comparison, the current state-of-the-art approaches achieved MAEs of 0.15 m/s for walking speed, 0.04 m/s for GDI, and 2.8\u00b0 for knee flexion angle at maximum extension.\n\nThe proposed framework has several advantages over the current state-of-the-art approaches. First, the proposed framework is more accurate and robust. Second, the proposed framework utilizes fewer parameters, which makes it more efficient. Third, the proposed framework alleviates the need for manual feature extraction, which makes it more user-friendly. Finally, the proposed framework can be easily extended to other gait parameters.\n\nIn conclusion, the proposed framework is a promising tool for gait analysis.
