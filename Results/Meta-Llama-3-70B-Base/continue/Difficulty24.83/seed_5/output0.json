            "Bias triangles represent features in stability diagrams of quantum dot (qd)devices, whose occurrence and property analysis are crucial indicators for spinphysics. Nevertheless, challenges associated with quality and availability ofdata as well as the subtlety of physical phenomena of interest have hindered anautomatic and bespoke analysis framework, often still relying (in part) onhuman labelling and verification. We introduce a feature extraction frameworkfor bias triangles, built from unsupervised, segmentation-based computer visionmethods, which facilitates the direct identification and quantification ofphysical properties of the former. Thereby, the need for human input or largetraining datasets to inform supervised learning approaches is circumvented,while additionally enabling the automation of pixelwise shape and featurelabeling. In particular, we demonstrate that Pauli spin blockade (PSB)detection can be conducted effectively, efficiently and without any trainingdata as a direct result of this approach. Additionally, the proposed frameworkcan be applied to other applications, such as image segmentation and objectdetection. For example, it can be used to detect objects in images, such ascars or people, or to segment images into different regions.

            "Bias triangles represent features in stability diagrams of quantum dot (qd) devices, whose occurrence and property analysis are crucial indicators for spin physics. Nevertheless, challenges associated with quality and availability of data as well as the subtlety of physical phenomena of interest have hindered an automatic and bespoke analysis framework, often still relying (in part) on human labelling and verification. We introduce a feature extraction framework for bias triangles, built from unsupervised, segmentation-based computer vision methods, which facilitates the direct identification and quantification of physical properties of the former. Thereby, the need for human input or large training datasets to inform supervised learning approaches is circumvented, while additionally enabling the automation of pixelwise shape and feature labeling. In particular, we demonstrate that Pauli spin blockade (PSB) detection can be conducted effectively, efficiently and without any training data as a direct result of this approach. Additionally, the proposed framework can be applied to other applications, such as image segmentation and object detection. For example, it can be used to detect objects in images, such as cars or people, or to segment images into different regions.

            "Bias triangles represent features in stability diagrams of quantum dot (qd) devices, whose occurrence and property analysis are crucial indicators for spin physics. Nevertheless, challenges associated with quality and availability of data as well as the subtlety of physical phenomena of interest have hindered an automatic and bespoke analysis framework, often still relying (in part) on human labelling and verification. We introduce a feature extraction framework for bias triangles, built from unsupervised, segmentation-based computer vision methods, which facilitates the direct identification and quantification of physical properties of the former. Thereby, the need for human input or large training datasets to inform supervised learning approaches is circumvented, while additionally enabling the automation of pixelwise shape and feature labeling. In particular, we demonstrate that Pauli spin blockade (PSB) detection can be conducted effectively, efficiently and without any training data as a direct result of this approach. Additionally, the proposed framework can be applied to other applications, such as image segmentation and object detection. For example, it can be used to detect objects in images, such as cars or people, or to segment images into different regions.
