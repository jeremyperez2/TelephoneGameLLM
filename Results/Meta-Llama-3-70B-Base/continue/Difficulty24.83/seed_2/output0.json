The unsupervised approach allows for the detection and segmentation of triangles without the need for labeled training data, which is particularly useful in cases where such data is scarce or unavailable. The segmentation-based approach enables the extraction of relevant features from the detected triangles, such as their shape and size, which can then be used to train a deep learning model for PSB detection.\nThe evaluation of the proposed framework was performed using a synthetic dataset of bias triangles with varying shapes and sizes.

            "Bias triangles represent features in stability diagrams of quantum dot (QD) devices, whose occurrence and property analysis are crucial indicators for spin physics. Nevertheless, challenges associated with quality and availability of data as well as the subtlety of physical phenomena of interest have hindered an automatic and bespoke analysis framework, often still relying (in part) on human labelling and verification. We introduce a feature extraction framework for bias triangles, built from unsupervised, segmentation-based computer vision methods, which facilitates the direct identification and quantification of physical properties of the former. Thereby, the need for human input or large training datasets to inform supervised learning approaches is circumvented, while additionally enabling the automation of pixelwise shape and feature labeling. In particular, we demonstrate that Pauli spin blockade (PSB) detection can be conducted effectively, efficiently and without any training data as a direct result of this approach.\nTo evaluate the performance of the proposed framework, we use a synthetic dataset of bias triangles with varying shapes and sizes. The results show that our method can accurately detect and segment the triangles with high precision and recall rates. Furthermore, we apply our framework to a real-world dataset of QD stability diagrams and demonstrate its ability to detect PSB regions with high accuracy.\nIn summary, we present a novel feature extraction framework for bias triangles that enables automatic and efficient analysis of QD stability diagrams. Our method can accurately detect and segment triangles with varying shapes and sizes, and can be used to detect PSB regions with high accuracy. We believe that our framework has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of QD device analysis and pave the way for new applications in quantum computing and other fields.\n\nThe proposed framework is a combination of unsupervised, segmentation-based computer vision methods and deep learning techniques.

The unsupervised approach allows for the detection and segmentation of triangles without the need for labeled training data, which is particularly useful in cases where such data is scarce or unavailable. The segmentation-based approach enables the extraction of relevant features from the detected triangles, such as their shape and size, which can then be used to train a deep learning model for PSB detection.\nThe evaluation of the proposed framework was performed using a synthetic dataset of bias triangles with varying shapes and sizes. The results showed that our method can accurately detect and segment the triangles with high precision and recall rates. Additionally, the framework was applied to a real-world dataset of QD stability diagrams and demonstrated its ability to detect PSB regions with high accuracy.\nIn summary, we present a novel feature extraction framework for bias triangles that enables automatic and efficient analysis of QD stability diagrams.

In particular, we demonstrate that Pauli spin blockade (PSB) detection can be conducted effectively, efficiently and without any training data as a direct result of this approach.\n\nTo evaluate the performance of the proposed framework, we use a synthetic dataset of bias triangles with varying shapes and sizes. The results show that our method can accurately detect and segment the triangles with high precision and recall rates. Furthermore, we apply our framework to a real-world dataset of QD stability diagrams and demonstrate its ability to detect PSB regions with high accuracy.\n\nIn summary, we present a novel feature extraction framework for bias triangles that enables automatic and efficient analysis of QD stability diagrams.

            "Bias triangles represent features in stability diagrams of quantum dot (QD) devices, whose occurrence and property analysis are crucial indicators for spin physics. Nevertheless, challenges associated with quality and availability of data as well as the subtlety of physical phenomena of interest have hindered an automatic and bespoke analysis framework, often still relying (in part) on human labelling and verification. We introduce a feature extraction framework for bias triangles, built from unsupervised, segmentation-based computer vision methods, which facilitates the direct identification and quantification of physical properties of the former. Thereby, the need for human input or large training datasets to inform supervised learning approaches is circumvented, while additionally enabling the automation of pixelwise shape and feature labeling. In particular, we demonstrate that Pauli spin blockade (PSB) detection can be conducted effectively, efficiently and without any training data as a direct result of this approach.\n\nTo evaluate the performance of the proposed framework, we use a synthetic dataset of bias triangles with varying shapes and sizes.
