            "We present a feature extraction framework for bias triangles, built from unsupervised, segmentation-based computer vision methods, which facilitates the direct identification and quantification of physical properties of the former. We demonstrate that Pauli spin blockade (PSB) detection can be conducted effectively, efficiently and without any training data as a direct result of this approach. The framework takes advantage of the fact that most of the information in the image is contained in the first few hundred eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. The eigenvalues are then used to construct a vector of features, which is then used to identify the bias triangle.\n\nThe framework can be used to detect bias triangles in any image, and it is particularly useful for detecting bias triangles in images of quantum dots.

            "We present a feature extraction framework for bias triangles, built from unsupervised, segmentation-based computer vision methods, which facilitates the direct identification and quantification of physical properties of the former.

            "We present a feature extraction framework for bias triangles, built from unsupervised, segmentation-based computer vision methods, which facilitates the direct identification and quantification of physical properties of the former. We demonstrate that Pauli spin blockade (PSB) detection can be conducted effectively, efficiently and without any training data as a direct result of this approach. The framework takes advantage of the fact that most of the information in the image is contained in the first few hundred eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. The eigenvalues are then used to construct a vector of features, which is then used to identify the bias triangle.\n\nThe framework can be used to detect bias triangles in any image, and it is particularly useful for detecting bias triangles in images of quantum dots.

            "We present a feature extraction framework for bias triangles, built from unsupervised, segmentation-based computer vision methods, which facilitates the direct identification and quantification of physical properties of the former. We demonstrate that Pauli spin blockade (PSB) detection can be conducted effectively, efficiently and without any training data as a direct result of this approach. The framework takes advantage of the fact that most of the information in the image is contained in the first few hundred eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. The eigenvalues are then used to construct a vector of features, which is then used to identify the bias triangle.\n\nThe framework can be used to detect bias triangles in any image, and it is particularly useful for detecting bias triangles in images of quantum dots.

            "The present paper presents a novel method for identifying and quantifying the physical properties of bias triangles, which are commonly observed in images of quantum dots.

            "The present paper presents a novel method for identifying and quantifying the physical properties of bias triangles, which are commonly observed in images of quantum dots. We introduce a feature extraction framework that takes advantage of the fact that most of the information in the image is contained in the first few hundred eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. The eigenvalues are then used to construct a vector of features, which is then used to identify the bias triangle.\n\nThe framework can be used to detect bias triangles in any image, and it is particularly useful for detecting bias triangles in images of quantum dots.

            "The present paper presents a novel method for identifying and quantifying the physical properties of bias triangles, which are commonly observed in images of quantum dots. We introduce a feature extraction framework that takes advantage of the fact that most of the information in the image is contained in the first few hundred eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. The eigenvalues are then used to construct a vector of features, which is then used to identify the bias triangle.\n\nThe framework can be used to detect bias triangles in any image, and it is particularly useful for detecting bias triangles in images of quantum dots. The framework is based on the following principles:\n\n    The bias triangle is a triangle that is formed by three points in the image. These points are the center of the quantum dot, the center of the electron cloud, and the center of the hole cloud.\n    The eigenvalues of the covariance matrix are used to construct a vector of features.

            "The present paper presents a novel method for identifying and quantifying the physical properties of bias triangles, which are commonly observed in images of quantum dots. We introduce a feature extraction framework that takes advantage of the fact that most of the information in the image is contained in the first few hundred eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. The eigenvalues are then used to construct a vector of features, which is then used to identify the bias triangle.\n\nThe framework can be used to detect bias triangles in any image, and it is particularly useful for detecting bias triangles in images of quantum dots.
