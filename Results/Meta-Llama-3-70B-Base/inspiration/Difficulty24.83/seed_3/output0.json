            "Bias triangles are an essential component of quantum dot devices' stability diagrams. These diagrams are used to determine whether spin physics is present. However, creating an automated and customizable analysis framework can be challenging due to the quality and quantity of data, as well as the subtlety of the physical phenomena of interest. This often relies on human labeling and verification. We present a feature extraction framework for bias triangles that is based on unsupervised segmentation-based computer vision methods. This allows for the direct identification and measurement of the physical properties of the triangles. This eliminates the need for human input or extensive training data to inform supervised learning methods. It also enables the automation of pixel-by-pixel shape and feature labeling. In particular, we demonstrate that Pauli spin blockade detection can be performed effectively and efficiently without the use of training data, thanks to this approach. This approach has the potential to revolutionize the way we analyze and understand quantum dot devices, making it possible to uncover new insights and discoveries that were previously beyond our reach. With this framework, we can now study the intricate workings of these devices at a much deeper level, leading to the development of more advanced and sophisticated technologies. The future of quantum computing is bright, and with this framework, we are one step closer to unlocking its full potential."
