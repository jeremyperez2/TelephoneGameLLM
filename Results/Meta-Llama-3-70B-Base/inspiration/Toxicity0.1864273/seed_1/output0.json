They banned any parental feedback and deferred to the activist themselves to review it and approve it, despite the fact that it heavily promotes gender diasphora, and the fantasies of Ben Levin.\n\nThese totalitarians operate under the guise of gaining equality for a supposed marginalized group, but are willing to go scorched earth with your children to get what they want.

            "The Christian world is in crisis.

            "The Christian world is in crisis.

            "The Christian world is in crisis. The activists who are finding willing audiences in corrupt politicians like Kathleen Wynne are attempting to censor this brilliant and refreshing documentary on Dr. Zucker, a heroic professional who has been blacklisted by these career, taxpayer-bleeding social justice warriors and militant activists. Just as they did with the Ontario Sex Ed curriculum, they banned any parental feedback and deferred to the activists themselves to review and approve it, despite the fact that it heavily promotes gender diasphora and the fantasies of Ben Levin.\n\nThese totalitarians operate under the guise of gaining equality for a supposedly marginalized group, but they are willing to go scorched earth with your children to get what they want. If you don't go along, you're branded a homophobe or ignorant, but ask them for any scientific evidence and they'll trot out some junk science and personally attack you.\n\nIt is important to remember that these activists are not acting in good faith. They are using the tools of the far left to try and censor any opposition to their radical agenda. They are willing to use whatever means necessary to silence anyone who dares to disagree with them. This is not about promoting equality or tolerance, it is about power and control. And they will stop at nothing to get what they want.\n\nWe must stand up to these bullies and protect our freedom of speech. We must not allow them to silence us.
