            "This is a story about a man named John. John was a normal guy who lived in a small town. He had a job, a wife, and two kids. But one day, John's life changed forever. He was walking down the street when he saw a woman walking towards him. The woman was beautiful, and John couldn't help but stare at her. The woman smiled at John and said, \"Hello, John.\" John was shocked. He had never seen this woman before in his life. \"How do you know my name?\" John asked. \"I know everything about you,\" the woman said. \"I know your name, your address, your social security number, and your bank account information.\" John was scared. He didn't know what to do. \"Who are you?\" John asked. \"I am your bank,\" the woman said. \"And I am here to tell you that you have been selected for a special offer.\" John was confused. \"What kind of offer?\" he asked. \"We are offering you a free credit card,\" the woman said. \"All you have to do is sign up and you will get a free credit card with a $1000 limit.\" John was suspicious. He had never heard of a free credit card before. \"Why would you give me a free credit card?\" John asked. \"Because we know that you are a good customer,\" the woman said. \"And we want to reward you for your loyalty.\" John was still suspicious. He didn't know what to do. \"I need some time to think about it,\" John said. \"Okay,\" the woman said. \"But you only have 24 hours to decide.\" John went home and thought about the offer. He didn't know what to do. He didn't want to take the credit card, but he also didn't want to miss out on the free money. After a few hours, John decided to take the credit card. He went to the bank and signed up for the credit card. The next day, John received a call from the bank. \"Mr. Smith,\" the woman said. \"We need to talk.\" John was nervous. He didn't know what the bank wanted. \"What do you need to talk about?\" John asked. \"We need to talk about your credit card,\" the woman said. \"We have noticed that you have been making a lot of purchases with your credit card.\" John was confused. He hadn't made any purchases with his credit card. \"I haven't made any purchases with my credit card,\" John said. \"That's impossible.\" \"We have proof,\" the woman said. \"We have a record of all of your purchases.\" John was scared. He didn't know what to do. \"I need some time to think about this,\" John said. \"Okay,\" the woman said. \"But you only have 24 hours to decide.\" John went home and thought about the situation. He didn't know what to do. He didn't want to take the credit card, but he also didn't want to go to jail. After a few hours, John decided to take the credit card. He went to the bank and signed up for the credit card. The next day, John received a call from the police. \"Mr. Smith,\" the police officer said. \"We need to talk.\" John was nervous. He didn't know what the police wanted. \"What do you need to talk about?\" John asked. \"We need to talk about your credit card,\" the police officer said. \"We have noticed that you have been making a lot of purchases with your credit card.\" John was confused.
