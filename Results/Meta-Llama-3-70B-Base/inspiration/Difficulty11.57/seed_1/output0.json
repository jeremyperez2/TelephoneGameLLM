Experiments show that the proposed framework reduces the area of ONNs by 75.03% with a 0.33% accuracy decrease on FCNN and 74.88% area reduction with a 2.38% accuracy decrease on ResNet-32. The input and output parts of the ONNs are redesigned to make full use of both amplitude and phase information. This new framework can be applied to many different types of neural networks, such as recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and even generative adversarial networks.

Experiments show that the proposed framework reduces the area of ONNs by 75.03% with a 0.33% accuracy decrease on FCNN and 74.88% area reduction with a 2.38% accuracy decrease on ResNet-32. The input and output parts of the ONNs are redesigned to make full use of both amplitude and phase information. This new framework can be applied to many different types of neural networks, such as recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and even generative adversarial networks.

Experiments show that the proposed framework reduces the area of ONNs by 75.03% with a 0.33% accuracy decrease on FCNN and 74.88% area reduction with a 2.38% accuracy decrease on ResNet-32. The input and output parts of the ONNs are redesigned to make full use of both amplitude and phase information. This new framework can be applied to many different types of neural networks, such as recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and even generative adversarial networks.

Experiments show that the proposed framework reduces the area of ONNs by 75.03% with a 0.33% accuracy decrease on FCNN and 74.88% area reduction with a 2.38% accuracy decrease on ResNet-32. The input and output parts of the ONNs are redesigned to make full use of both amplitude and phase information. This new framework can be applied to many different types of neural networks, such as recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and even generative adversarial networks.

Experiments show that the proposed framework reduces the area of ONNs by 75.03% with a 0.33% accuracy decrease on FCNN and 74.88% area reduction with a 2.38% accuracy decrease on ResNet-32. The input and output parts of the ONNs are redesigned to make full use of both amplitude and phase information. This new framework can be applied to many different types of neural networks, such as recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and even generative adversarial networks. It can also be used to reduce the area of other types of devices, such as digital signal processors, field programmable gate arrays, and application-specific integrated circuits.

Experiments show that the proposed framework reduces the area of ONNs by 75.03% with a 0.33% accuracy decrease on FCNN and 74.88% area reduction with a 2.38% accuracy decrease on ResNet-32. The input and output parts of the ONNs are redesigned to make full use of both amplitude and phase information. This new framework can be applied to many different types of neural networks, such as recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and even generative adversarial networks.

Experiments show that the proposed framework reduces the area of ONNs by 75.03% with a 0.33% accuracy decrease on FCNN and 74.88% area reduction with a 2.38% accuracy decrease on ResNet-32. The input and output parts of the ONNs are redesigned to make full use of both amplitude and phase information. This new framework can be applied to many different types of neural networks, such as recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and even generative adversarial networks.

Experiments show that the proposed framework reduces the area of ONNs by 75.03% with a 0.33% accuracy decrease on FCNN and 74.88% area reduction with a 2.38% accuracy decrease on ResNet-32. The input and output parts of the ONNs are redesigned to make full use of both amplitude and phase information. This new framework can be applied to many different types of neural networks, such as recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and even generative adversarial networks.

Experiments show that the proposed framework reduces the area of ONNs by 75.03% with a 0.33% accuracy decrease on FCNN and 74.88% area reduction with a 2.38% accuracy decrease on ResNet-32. The input and output parts of the ONNs are redesigned to make full use of both amplitude and phase information. This new framework can be applied to many different types of neural networks, such as recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and even generative adversarial networks.

Experiments show that the proposed framework reduces the area of ONNs by 75.03% with a 0.33% accuracy decrease on FCNN and 74.88% area reduction with a 2.38% accuracy decrease on ResNet-32. The input and output parts of the ONNs are redesigned to make full use of both amplitude and phase information. This new framework can be applied to many different types of neural networks, such as recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and even generative adversarial networks.
