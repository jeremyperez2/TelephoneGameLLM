            "Having the potential for high speed, high throughput, and low energy cost, optical neural networks (ONNs) have emerged as a promising candidate for accelerating deep learning tasks. In conventional ONNs, light amplitudes are modulated at the input and detected at the output. However, the light phases are still ignored in conventional structures, although they can also carry information for computing. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a framework called OPLIXNET to compress the areas of ONNs by modulating input image data into the amplitudes and phase parts of light signals. The input and output parts of the ONNs are redesigned to make full use of both amplitude and phase information. Moreover, mutual learning across different ONN structures is introduced to maintain the accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly reduces the areas of ONNs with the accuracy within an acceptable range. For instance, 75.03% area is reduced with a 0.33% accuracy decrease on fully connected neural network (FCNN) and 74.88% area is reduced with a 2.38% accuracy decrease on ResNet-32. \n\nThe proposed framework can significantly reduce the areas of ONNs with the accuracy within an acceptable range.

For instance, 75.03% area is reduced with a 0.33% accuracy decrease on fully connected neural network (FCNN) and 74.88% area is reduced with a 2.38% accuracy decrease on ResNet-32. The reduction in area is due to the use of a lower precision representation for the weights and activations, which reduces the memory footprint of the model.
