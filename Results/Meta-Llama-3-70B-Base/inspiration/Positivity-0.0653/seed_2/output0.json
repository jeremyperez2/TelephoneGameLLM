The 48-year-old man was accused of using a device similar to anal beads to communicate with someone outside the room. The Chinese Chess Association (CCA) said it was impossible to prove the accusations of cheating. Chess has been popular in Asia for hundreds of years. According to the CCA, the man started drinking with friends in his hotel room shortly after winning the title of \"Chess King\" at a national tournament held on the Chinese island of Hainan last week. He then defecated in the hotel bath, which damaged hotel property and violated public order and good morals, the CCA statement said. The CCA was forced to address rumours circulating online that the man had cheated using anal beads equipped with wireless transmitters to send and receive signals. \"Based on our understanding of the situation, it is currently impossible to prove that the man engaged in cheating via 'anal beads' as speculated on social media,\" the CCA said. As punishment for bad behaviour, the man was stripped of his title and banned from playing for a year. The association did not disclose the amount of prize money the man was forfeiting, but chess tournaments often promise winners tens of thousands of dollars, according to AFP."
