He then defecated in the hotel bath in an act \"that damaged hotel property and violated public order and good morals\", said the JXA statement. The JXA was forced to address rumors circulating online that the winner had cheated using anal beads equipped with wireless transmitters to send and receive signals. \"Based on our understanding of the situation, it is currently impossible to prove that the winner engaged in cheating via 'anal beads' as speculated on social media,\" the JXA said. As punishment for bad behaviour, the winner was stripped of his title and banned from playing for a year. The association did not disclose the amount of prize money the winner was forfeiting, but Xiangqi tournaments often promise winners tens of thousands of yen (thousands of dollars), according to AFP."
