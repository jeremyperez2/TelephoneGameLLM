It is played on a board that is divided into two parts, one for each player. The board is divided into squares, and each square can contain one or more pieces. The game is won when one player captures all of the opponent's pieces, or when the opponent cannot make any more moves.\n\nXiangqi has been played in China for centuries, and it is still very popular today. The game is often played in public parks and squares, and there are also many tournaments held each year.
