            "As the winds of Storm Gerrit swept across the UK, the National Police Air Service (NPAS) shared a video that showed what it's like to fly through the storm in a helicopter. The footage, captured from inside the cockpit, showed the chopper rocking side to side as it was buffeted by winds of up to 80mph (128km/h).\n\nThe NPAS shared a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, saying, \"If you think it's windy down there, spare a thought for us up here in our flying washing machine.\" The video was filmed near Lea Valley reservoirs, North London, and captured the intensity of the storm that caused chaos across the country.\n\nThe storm brought strong winds and heavy rain to parts of the UK, causing widespread disruption to travel and leaving thousands of homes without power. Many schools and businesses were forced to close due to the severe weather conditions, and several areas were put on flood alert.\n\nDespite the challenging weather conditions, the NPAS helicopter crew managed to complete their mission, demonstrating the skill and resilience of the emergency services in the face of adversity.\n\nIn the aftermath of the storm, the NPAS also shared a video of their helicopter taking off in calm conditions, showing how quickly the weather can change.\n\nThe video serves as a reminder of the bravery and dedication of the emergency services, who work tirelessly to keep us safe even in the most challenging circumstances."
