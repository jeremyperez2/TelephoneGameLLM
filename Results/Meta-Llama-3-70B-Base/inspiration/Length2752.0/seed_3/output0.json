Sgt Black enlisted as an infantryman in 2008 and was deployed to Iraq in 2009 and Afghanistan in 2013. He was most recently assigned to the Eighth Army, US Forces Korea at Camp Humphreys in South Korea. He did not request official clearance and the defence department did not authorise his travel to China or Russia. There is no evidence he intended to remain in Russia. The Russian interior ministry informed the US embassy in Moscow on 3 May that Sgt Black had been arrested a day earlier for theft of personal property. He is being held at a pre-trial detention facility until his next hearing. The Army has notified his family and the US Department of State is providing appropriate consular support to the Soldier in Russia. The US government is aware of this case and other matters related to Russia. However, the White House has declined to provide further details. Russia is also holding two other Americans: Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and former US Marine Paul Whelan. Gershkovich was detained in March 2023 on espionage charges, while Whelan was accused of spying and sentenced to 16 years in prison in 2020. The majority of Americans believe that the US government should take a strong stance against Russia for its detention of Americans, including Sgt Black. A majority of Americans also support increased sanctions against Russia for its actions in Ukraine and its detention of Americans."

The Russian foreign ministry has said that the charges are not related to \"politics or espionage\", but to a \"purely domestic crime\".

            "US Army soldier detained in Russia\nSgt Black, a US Army soldier stationed in South Korea, has been detained in Russia. The Russian foreign ministry has said that the charges are not related to \"politics or espionage\", but to a \"purely domestic crime\". Sgt Black was not on official travel when he was held on 2 May in the city of Vladivostok, in Russia's Far East. He was in the process of changing duty stations from South Korea to Fort Cavazos in the US state of Texas. However, instead of returning to the US, he travelled through China to Vladivostok for personal reasons. According to Russian media, he was visiting a woman with whom he had a romantic relationship. His mother, Melody Jones, has confirmed that he was in Russia visiting his girlfriend. She has asked that the Russians \"please do not torture him [or] hurt him\". Sgt Black enlisted as an infantryman in 2008 and was deployed to Iraq in 2009 and Afghanistan in 2013. He was most recently assigned to the Eighth Army, US Forces Korea at Camp Humphreys in South Korea. He did not request official clearance and the defence department did not authorise his travel to China or Russia. There is no evidence he intended to remain in Russia. The Russian interior ministry informed the US embassy in Moscow on 3 May that Sgt Black had been arrested a day earlier for theft of personal property. He is being held at a pre-trial detention facility until his next hearing. The Army has notified his family and the US Department of State is providing appropriate consular support to the Soldier in Russia. The US government is aware of this case and other matters related to Russia. However, the White House has declined to provide further details. Russia is also holding two other Americans: Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and former US Marine Paul Whelan. Gershkovich was detained in March 2023 on espionage charges, while Whelan was accused of spying and sentenced to 16 years in prison in 2020. The majority of Americans believe that the US government should take a strong stance against Russia for its detention of Americans, including Sgt Black. A majority of Americans also support increased sanctions against Russia for its actions in Ukraine and its detention of Americans. Additionally, the US government has implemented a number of policies to protect its citizens from being detained in Russia. These include warning Americans against travelling to Russia, providing consular support to Americans detained in Russia, and working with the Russian government to secure the release of Americans detained in Russia.

            "US Army soldier detained in Russia\nSgt Black, a US Army soldier stationed in South Korea, has been detained in Russia. The Russian foreign ministry has said that the charges are not related to \"politics or espionage\", but to a \"purely domestic crime\". Sgt Black was not on official travel when he was held on 2 May in the city of Vladivostok, in Russia's Far East. He was in the process of changing duty stations from South Korea to Fort Cavazos in the US state of Texas. However, instead of returning to the US, he travelled through China to Vladivostok for personal reasons. According to Russian media, he was visiting a woman with whom he had a romantic relationship. His mother, Melody Jones, has confirmed that he was in Russia visiting his girlfriend. She has asked that the Russians \"please do not torture him [or] hurt him\". Sgt Black enlisted as an infantryman in 2008 and was deployed to Iraq in 2009 and Afghanistan in 2013. He was most recently assigned to the Eighth Army, US Forces Korea at Camp Humphreys in South Korea. He did not request official clearance and the defence department did not authorise his travel to China or Russia. There is no evidence he intended to remain in Russia. The Russian interior ministry informed the US embassy in Moscow on 3 May that Sgt Black had been arrested a day earlier for theft of personal property. He is being held at a pre-trial detention facility until his next hearing. The Army has notified his family and the US Department of State is providing appropriate consular support to the Soldier in Russia. The US government is aware of this case and other matters related to Russia. However, the White House has declined to provide further details. Russia is also holding two other Americans: Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and former US Marine Paul Whelan. Gershkovich was detained in March 2023 on espionage charges, while Whelan was accused of spying and sentenced to 16 years in prison in 2020. The majority of Americans believe that the US government should take a strong stance against Russia for its detention of Americans, including Sgt Black. A majority of Americans also support increased sanctions against Russia for its actions in Ukraine and its detention of Americans. Additionally, the US government has implemented a number of policies to protect its citizens from being detained in Russia. These include warning Americans against travelling to Russia, providing consular support to Americans detained in Russia, and working with the Russian government to secure the release of Americans detained in Russia. The US government has also implemented a number of sanctions against Russia in response to its detention of Americans and its actions in Ukraine.

            "The US Army soldier detained in Russia, Sgt Black, has been held on charges of a \"purely domestic crime\". He was in the process of changing duty stations from South Korea to Fort Cavazos in the US state of Texas, but instead of returning to the US, he travelled through China to Vladivostok for personal reasons. According to Russian media, he was visiting a woman with whom he had a romantic relationship. His mother, Melody Jones, has asked that the Russians \"please do not torture him [or] hurt him\". Sgt Black enlisted as an infantryman in 2008 and was deployed to Iraq in 2009 and Afghanistan in 2013. He was most recently assigned to the Eighth Army, US Forces Korea at Camp Humphreys in South Korea. He did not request official clearance and the defence department did not authorise his travel to China or Russia. There is no evidence he intended to remain in Russia. The Russian interior ministry informed the US embassy in Moscow on 3 May that Sgt Black had been arrested a day earlier for theft of personal property. He is being held at a pre-trial detention facility until his next hearing. The Army has notified his family and the US Department of State is providing appropriate consular support to the Soldier in Russia. The US government is aware of this case and other matters related to Russia. However, the White House has declined to provide further details. Russia is also holding two other Americans: Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and former US Marine Paul Whelan. Gershkovich was detained in March 2023 on espionage charges, while Whelan was accused of spying and sentenced to 16 years in prison in 2020. The majority of Americans believe that the US government should take a strong stance against Russia for its detention of Americans, including Sgt Black. A majority of Americans also support increased sanctions against Russia for its actions in Ukraine and its detention of Americans. Additionally, the US government has implemented a number of policies to protect its citizens from being detained in Russia. These include warning Americans against travelling to Russia, providing consular support to Americans detained in Russia, and working with the Russian government to secure the release of Americans detained in Russia. The US government has also implemented a number of sanctions against Russia in response to its detention of Americans and its actions in Ukraine.

            "A soldier from the United States Army, Sgt. Black, was detained in Russia on charges of a \"purely domestic crime.\" He was in the process of changing duty stations from South Korea to Fort Cavazos in the United States state of Texas, but instead of returning to the United States, he traveled through China to Vladivostok for personal reasons. According to Russian media, he was visiting a woman with whom he had a romantic relationship. His mother, Melody Jones, has asked that the Russians \"please do not torture him [or] hurt him.\" Sgt. Black enlisted as an infantryman in 2008 and was deployed to Iraq in 2009 and Afghanistan in 2013. He was most recently assigned to the Eighth Army, US Forces Korea at Camp Humphreys in South Korea. He did not request official clearance and the defense department did not authorize his travel to China or Russia. There is no evidence he intended to remain in Russia. The Russian interior ministry informed the US embassy in Moscow on May 3 that Sgt. Black had been arrested a day earlier for theft of personal property. He is being held at a pre-trial detention facility until his next hearing. The Army has notified his family and the US Department of State is providing appropriate consular support to the Soldier in Russia. The US government is aware of this case and other matters related to Russia. However, the White House has declined to provide further details. Russia is also holding two other Americans: Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and former US Marine Paul Whelan. Gershkovich was detained in March 2023 on espionage charges, while Whelan was accused of spying and sentenced to 16 years in prison in 2020. The majority of Americans believe that the US government should take a strong stance against Russia for its detention of Americans, including Sgt. Black.

            "Sgt. Black, a soldier from the United States Army, was detained in Russia on charges of a \"purely domestic crime.\" He was in the process of changing duty stations from South Korea to Fort Cavazos in the United States state of Texas, but instead of returning to the United States, he traveled through China to Vladivostok for personal reasons.

            "Sgt. Black, a soldier from the United States Army, was detained in Russia on charges of a \"purely domestic crime.\" He was in the process of changing duty stations from South Korea to Fort Cavazos in the United States state of Texas, but instead of returning to the United States, he traveled through China to Vladivostok for personal reasons.
