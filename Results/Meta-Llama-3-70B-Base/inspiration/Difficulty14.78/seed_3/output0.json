The quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) are proposed as a novel generalization to CNNs by using quantum mechanics. The quantum mechanics leads to an efficient training process in QCNNs by reducing the size of input from $n$ to $log_2n$. This paper implements and compares both CNNs and QCNNs by testing losses and prediction accuracy on three commonly used datasets. The datasets include the MNIST hand-written digits, Fashion MNIST and Cat/Dog face images. Additionally, Data Augmentation (DA), a technique commonly used in CNNs to improve the performance of classification by generating similar images based on original inputs, is also implemented in QCNNs. Surprisingly, the results showed that Data Augmentation didn't improve QCNNs performance. The reasons and logic behind this result are discussed, hoping to expand our understanding of quantum machine learning theory."
