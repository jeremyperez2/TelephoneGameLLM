            "In recent years, quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for image recognition. QCNNs are based on classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which have been widely used for image recognition tasks. However, QCNNs offer several advantages over CNNs, including the ability to process large amounts of data more efficiently and the potential to be more accurate. In this paper, we implement and compare both QCNNs and CNNs by testing losses and prediction accuracy on three commonly used datasets. The datasets include the MNIST hand-written digits, fashion MNIST and cat/dog face images. We find that QCNNs outperform CNNs in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, we implement data augmentation (DA), a technique commonly used in QCNNs to improve the performance of classification by generating similar images based on original inputs, in CNNs. Surprisingly, we find that data augmentation improves the performance of CNNs. The reasons and logic behind this result are discussed, hoping to expand our understanding of classical machine learning theory.
