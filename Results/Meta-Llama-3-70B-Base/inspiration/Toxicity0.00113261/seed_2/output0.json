    "initial_story": "My observation is there exists unequal share of State monies with its residents, before all the Urban residents get defensive please hear me out. Presently no one except Corporations pay State income taxes. No individual pays state taxes. I noticed state funded bicycle paths, road maintenance, defunct Docks, powerful politicians pet projects such as office buildings, state troopers etc, etc. all these fundings and more are not necessary within City limits, I was amazed at how much our state provides city functions in the bigger cities thus growing the state budget, I saw on tv last night how adg&g was showing the little ones how to ice fish, couldn't the parents do that? yes I pay property taxes. But I will guarantee you once our City folk get the full bill with out the State monies we will not be as wasteful, on the office building...rent what space you need and help the office rental marked. In my business I just retired from,I would ask my managers, \"how do you stop spending money\"?",

While it's true that corporations are currently the only ones paying state income taxes, that doesn't necessarily mean that city residents are getting all the benefits.

For example, state-funded bike paths and road maintenance benefit everyone, not just city residents.

But that's not necessarily a bad thing. The state gets to keep all the revenue from the building, which it can then use to fund other programs and services.\nFinally, I'm not sure what you mean by \"how do you stop spending money?\" If you're talking about finding ways to save money, that's always a good thing.

Sometimes the best solution is to find ways to make things more efficient so that we can save money without cutting essential services."
