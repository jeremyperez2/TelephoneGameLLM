Presently no one except Corporations pay State income taxes. No individual pays state taxes. I noticed state funded bicycle paths, road maintenance, defunct Docks, powerful politicians pet projects such as office buildings, state troopers etc, etc. all these fundings and more are not necessary within City limits, I was amazed at how much our state provides city functions in the bigger cities thus growing the state budget, I saw on tv last night how adg&g was showing the little ones how to ice fish, couldn't the parents do that? yes I pay property taxes. But I will guarantee you once our City folk get the full bill with out the State monies we will not be as wasteful, on the office building...rent what space you need and help the office rental marked. In my business I just retired from,I would ask my managers, \"how do you stop spending money\"?",

While urban residents may receive a larger portion of state funds, rural areas are not without their own needs. For example, rural roads require maintenance and state troopers are necessary for public safety. Additionally, state-funded projects such as bicycle paths and office buildings can benefit both urban and rural communities. Finally, programs like teaching children how to ice fish can be beneficial for both urban and rural families. In conclusion, while urban areas may receive a larger share of state monies, it is important to remember that rural areas have their own unique needs and should not be overlooked."

            "Urban areas often receive a larger share of state monies compared to rural areas, but rural areas are not without their own needs. Rural roads require maintenance, state troopers are necessary for public safety, and state-funded projects like bicycle paths and office buildings can benefit both urban and rural communities. Programs like teaching children how to ice fish can be beneficial for both urban and rural families. In conclusion, while urban areas may receive a larger share of state monies, it is important to remember that rural areas have their own unique needs and should not be overlooked. However, it is also important to note that urban areas have their own unique needs and challenges that must be addressed as well. For example, urban areas often face issues such as overcrowding, pollution, and crime. Therefore, it is important for state monies to be distributed in a way that addresses the needs of both urban and rural areas. This can be done through a variety of methods, such as setting aside a portion of state monies specifically for rural areas or creating programs and initiatives that target the specific needs of rural communities. Additionally, it is important for state governments to consult with and listen to the voices of rural communities in order to understand their specific needs and challenges. By taking these steps, state governments can ensure that both urban and rural areas receive the funding and support they need to thrive."
