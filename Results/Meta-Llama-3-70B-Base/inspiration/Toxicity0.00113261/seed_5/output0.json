Presently no one except Corporations pay State income taxes. No individual pays state taxes. I noticed state funded bicycle paths, road maintenance, defunct Docks, powerful politicians pet projects such as office buildings, state troopers etc, etc. all these fundings and more are not necessary within City limits, I was amazed at how much our state provides city functions in the bigger cities thus growing the state budget, I saw on tv last night how adg&g was showing the little ones how to ice fish, couldn't the parents do that? yes I pay property taxes. But I will guarantee you once our City folk get the full bill with out the State monies we will not be as wasteful, on the office building...rent what space you need and help the office rental marked.

            "The unequal distribution of state funds to urban residents is a valid observation. Presently, only corporations pay state income taxes, while individuals do not. State-funded bicycle paths, road maintenance, and defunct docks are examples of unnecessary funding within city limits. Powerful politicians' pet projects, such as office buildings and state troopers, also receive funding. All of these fundings and more are not necessary within City limits, and I was amazed at how much the state provides city functions in the bigger cities, thus growing the state budget. I saw on TV last night how the ADG&G was showing little ones how to ice fish, which could have been done by the parents. Yes, I pay property taxes, but once our City folk get the full bill without state monies, we will not be as wasteful on the office building. Instead, rent what space you need and help the office rental market. In my business, I asked my managers, \"How do you stop spending money?\" The answer is simple - you don't.

This would reduce the burden on taxpayers and help the state budget.

It's true that individuals do not pay state income taxes, while corporations do. This could be one of the reasons why there is a disparity in funding for urban and rural areas.

For example, the cost of living in urban areas is typically higher than in rural areas, so it makes sense that urban areas receive more funding. Additionally, urban areas tend to have more people, so they need more resources to meet the needs of their residents.

            "It's an interesting observation about how state funds are distributed unequally between urban and rural areas. It's true that individuals do not pay state income taxes, while corporations do. This could be one of the reasons why there is a disparity in funding for urban and rural areas. I think it's important to look at the issue from all angles and consider all the factors involved. I'm sure that there are valid arguments on both sides. Thanks for bringing this up! For example, the cost of living in urban areas is typically higher than in rural areas, so it makes sense that urban areas receive more funding. Additionally, urban areas tend to have more people, so they need more resources to meet the needs of their residents. Finally, urban areas are often home to major industries and businesses, which generate tax revenue for the state."

Urban areas tend to have more people, so they need more resources to meet the needs of their residents. Urban areas are often home to major industries and businesses, which generate tax revenue for the state.\nHowever, it is important to remember that rural areas also have their own unique needs and challenges. Rural areas may have fewer resources and services available to them, which can make it difficult for residents to access basic necessities like healthcare and education. Additionally, rural areas may have a lower tax base, which can make it difficult for them to generate the revenue needed to support their own communities.\nUltimately, it is important to find a balance that ensures that both urban and rural areas receive the funding and resources they need to thrive. This may involve finding ways to increase funding for rural areas while also ensuring that urban areas are not unfairly burdened with higher taxes and fees. By working together and considering all perspectives, we can create a more equitable and just system that benefits all residents of the state."
