I went downstairs and saw that there was a fire on the ground floor. I called the fire department and they told me that it was a small fire and that they would take care of it. I went back to my office and waited for the fire department to arrive. When they arrived, they told me that the fire was out and that everything was okay. I was relieved and I went back to work.\n\nThe next day, I got a call from the fire department. They said that they had found a body in the building. The body was burnt beyond recognition. They said that they were going to do a DNA test on the body to see if they could identify the person. I was shocked and I told them that I would help them in any way that I could. I went to the police station and they told me that they were going to do an investigation into the death. I was shocked and I told them that I would help them in any way that I could. I went to the morgue and I saw the body of the person who had died. I was shocked and I told them that I would help them in any way that I could.\n\nThe police investigation was going on for a few days and then they told me that they had found the killer. The killer was a man who was angry at the company that owned the building. He had set the fire on purpose and he had killed the person who was in the building. I was shocked and I told them that I would help them in any way that I could. I went to the police station and I told them that I would testify in court against the killer. I was shocked and I told them that I would help them in any way that I could.\n\nThe trial was going on for a few weeks and then the jury found the killer guilty. The killer was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. I was shocked and I told them that I would help them in any way that I could. I went to the prison and I visited the killer. I told him that I was sorry for what he had done. I told him that I would help him in any way that I could.
