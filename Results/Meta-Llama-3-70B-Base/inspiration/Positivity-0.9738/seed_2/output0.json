The investigation is still ongoing, and the authorities have not released any further information about the incident. It is important to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity to the police.\n\nIn the meantime, Mr Freer and his team are working to ensure that their constituency office can continue to serve the community as soon as possible. They are grateful for the support they have received from the police and fire brigade, as well as from the community.\n\nIt is a reminder of the importance of fire safety and the need to take precautions to prevent fires from happening in the first place. By working together, we can make our communities safer and prevent incidents like this from happening in the future."
