My orders were to report to a training camp in the middle of nowhere, where I would be taught how to kill. I didn't know it then, but I would soon be fighting for my life in the jungles of Vietnam. \n\nThe first few weeks of training were tough. The days were long and the nights were even longer. We were woken up at the crack of dawn and put through a grueling schedule of physical training and drill. It was exhausting, but it was also necessary. We needed to be in peak physical condition if we were going to survive in combat.\n\nAfter a few weeks, we were finally sent to Vietnam. We landed in the middle of the night and were immediately thrown into the thick of the action. The fighting was intense and brutal. We fought tooth and nail against an enemy that was determined to kill us all. It was a life-changing experience. I saw things that I will never forget. I lost friends and comrades. But I also learned what it means to be a soldier. I learned that the bond between soldiers is unbreakable. We were there for each other, no matter what. \n\nI came back from Vietnam a changed man. I had seen the horrors of war and I knew that I never wanted to experience that again. But I also knew that I had to do my part to prevent it from happening to others. I became an advocate for peace and I dedicated my life to helping others. I am proud of what I did in Vietnam and I am proud of the man that I became because of it."

He needed to be in peak physical condition if he was going to survive in combat.\n\nAfter a few weeks, he was finally sent to Vietnam. He landed in the middle of the night and was immediately thrown into the thick of the action. The fighting was intense and brutal. He fought tooth and nail against an enemy that was determined to kill him. It was a life-changing experience. He saw things that he will never forget. He lost friends and comrades. But he also learned what it means to be a soldier. He learned that the bond between soldiers is unbreakable. They were there for each other, no matter what. \n\nHe came back from Vietnam a changed man. He had seen the horrors of war and he knew that he never wanted to experience that again.
