            "Musculoskeletal diseases and cognitive impairments in patients lead to difficulties in movement as well as negative effects on their psychological health. Clinical gait analysis, a vital tool for early diagnosis and treatment, traditionally relies on expensive optical motion capture systems. Recent advances in computer vision and deep learning have opened the door to more accessible and cost-effective alternatives. This paper introduces a novel spatio-temporal transformer network to estimate critical gait parameters from RGB videos captured by a single-view camera. Empirical evaluations on a public dataset of cerebral palsy patients indicate that the proposed framework surpasses current state-of-the-art approaches and shows significant improvements in predicting general gait parameters (including walking speed, Gait Deviation Index - GDI, and knee flexion angle at maximum extension), while utilizing fewer parameters and alleviating the need for manual feature extraction. The results suggest that the proposed approach could be used to assist in the diagnosis and treatment of musculoskeletal diseases, providing a more cost-effective and accessible alternative to traditional methods.\n\nThe proposed framework is a spatio-temporal transformer network, which is able to extract and utilize information from both spatial and temporal dimensions of the video data. This allows it to better capture the subtle changes in gait parameters over time, which is essential for accurate estimation. The framework is also designed to be computationally efficient, utilizing fewer parameters and alleviating the need for manual feature extraction. This makes it a more cost-effective and accessible alternative to traditional methods.\n\nOverall, the proposed framework shows significant improvements in predicting general gait parameters, while utilizing fewer parameters and alleviating the need for manual feature extraction.

            "Recent developments in AI and computer vision have made affordable and accessible tools for early diagnosis and treatment of musculoskeletal diseases and cognitive impairments possible. Clinical gait analysis, a crucial tool in this process, traditionally relies on expensive optical motion capture systems. However, the spatio-temporal transformer network introduced in this paper shows significant improvements in predicting general gait parameters, such as walking speed, Gait Deviation Index (GDI), and knee flexion angle at maximum extension. The framework utilizes fewer parameters, alleviates the need for manual feature extraction, and utilizes information from both spatial and temporal dimensions of video data. This allows it to capture subtle changes in gait parameters over time, which is essential for accurate estimation. Empirical evaluations on a public dataset of cerebral palsy patients indicate that the proposed framework surpasses current state-of-the-art approaches. The results suggest that the proposed approach could be used to assist in the diagnosis and treatment of musculoskeletal diseases, providing a more cost-effective and accessible alternative to traditional methods.\n\nThe proposed framework is a spatio-temporal transformer network, which is able to extract and utilize information from both spatial and temporal dimensions of the video data.

            "In recent years, there have been significant advancements in the field of artificial intelligence and computer vision, leading to the development of cost-effective and accessible tools for early diagnosis and treatment of musculoskeletal diseases and cognitive impairments. One such tool is clinical gait analysis, which plays a crucial role in this process. However, traditional methods of clinical gait analysis rely on expensive optical motion capture systems, which can be limiting. To address this, researchers have proposed a new framework that utilizes a spatio-temporal transformer network for predicting general gait parameters such as walking speed, Gait Deviation Index (GDI), and knee flexion angle at maximum extension. This framework uses fewer parameters, alleviates the need for manual feature extraction, and utilizes information from both spatial and temporal dimensions of video data. This allows it to capture subtle changes in gait parameters over time, which is essential for accurate estimation. Empirical evaluations on a public dataset of cerebral palsy patients indicate that the proposed framework outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches.
