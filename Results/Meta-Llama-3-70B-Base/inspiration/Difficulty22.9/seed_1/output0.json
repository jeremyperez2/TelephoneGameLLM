            "A novel spatio-temporal transformer network is proposed to estimate crucial gait parameters from rgb videos captured by a single-view camera. The framework significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches and demonstrates remarkable improvements in predicting general gait parameters such as walking speed, gait deviation index (gdi), and knee flexion angle at maximum extension. The proposed method is more accessible and cost-effective compared to traditional clinical gait analysis that relies on expensive optical motion capture systems. Furthermore, the method may provide valuable insights into the assessment of musculoskeletal diseases, cognitive impairments, and psychological health in patients, leading to earlier diagnosis and treatment.\n\nHowever, there are still some limitations to the proposed method. For instance, the accuracy of the estimation may be affected by the quality of the input video. Additionally, the method may not be able to accurately predict the gait parameters of people with severe gait abnormalities or those who are not walking in a straight line.

            "Gait analysis is an important tool in the diagnosis and treatment of musculoskeletal and neurological disorders. The current gold standard for gait analysis involves the use of expensive and time-consuming motion capture systems. In recent years, however, there has been a growing interest in the development of more accessible and cost-effective methods for gait analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel method for gait analysis using a single-view RGB video. Our method involves the use of a deep learning model that is trained to estimate various gait parameters, such as walking speed, gait deviation index (GDI), and knee flexion angle at maximum extension, from the video. We evaluate our method on a publicly available gait dataset and demonstrate that it significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches. We also discuss the potential applications of our method in clinical settings and sports science, and highlight its limitations and future research directions."

This paper proposes a novel method for gait analysis using a single-view RGB video. The method uses a deep learning model to estimate various gait parameters, including walking speed, gait deviation index (GDI), and knee flexion angle at maximum extension. The method is evaluated on a publicly available gait dataset and outperforms existing approaches. The method has potential applications in clinical settings and sports science, and the authors discuss its limitations and future research directions.\n\nGait analysis is a useful tool for diagnosing and treating musculoskeletal and neurological conditions.

The proposed method has potential applications in clinical settings, where it can be used to assess patients' gait; and in sports science, where it can be used to analyze athletes' performance. However, the proposed method has some limitations, such as the need for a large amount of training data, and the fact that it is currently limited to single-view RGB videos. In the future, we plan to address these limitations by developing a method that can work with multi-view videos and/or 3D data."

            "We propose a novel method for estimating gait parameters from a single-view RGB video using a deep learning model. This method is evaluated on a publicly available gait dataset and outperforms existing approaches. Our method has potential applications in clinical settings and sports science, and we discuss its limitations and future research directions. The proposed method consists of two main steps: first, a deep learning model is trained to predict gait parameters from a single-view RGB video; second, the predicted gait parameters are used to estimate the subject's gait. The proposed method is evaluated on the publicly available GaitDB dataset, and the results show that our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of both accuracy and robustness. The proposed method has potential applications in clinical settings, where it can be used to assess patients' gait; and in sports science, where it can be used to analyze athletes' performance.
