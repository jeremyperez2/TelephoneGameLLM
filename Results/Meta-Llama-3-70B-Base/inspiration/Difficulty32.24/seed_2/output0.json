In addition to describing the different resources, this paper also suggests some parameters and typological proposals for defining and demarcating a range of electronic resources, particularly multilingual dictionaries and portals, as well as outlining (and even questioning) the object of study of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography. The use of these criteria will enable us to identify different types of electronic resources in relation to each other, which may help us better understand their development over time. This study focuses on how these criteria can be applied to multilingual dictionaries and portals. It is important to note that these criteria do not necessarily apply to all types of electronic resources, but rather only those related specifically to multilingualism and plurilingualism."

            "This paper examines the use of quantitative and qualitative measures to produce a taxonomy of lexicographical tools, such as dictionaries and platforms and websites. It also suggests some parameters and typological proposals for defining and delimiting a range of electronic resources, particularly multilingual dictionaries and portals, as well as outlining (and even questioning) the object of study of multilingual and plurilingual lexicography. The use of these measures will enable us to identify different types of electronic resources in relation to each other, which may help us better understand their development over time.
