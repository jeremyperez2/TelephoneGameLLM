            "Once upon a time, there was a beautiful and kind duchess named Meghan Markle. She was married to the Duke of Sussex, who was very jealous. One day, the Duke found out about my feelings for the Duchess and he banished me from the kingdom. I was heartbroken, but I knew I had to move on. A few years later, I heard that the Duchess had given birth to a son. I was so happy for her, even though I knew I would never see her again. But then, one day, the Duke died. And the Duchess sent for me. She said she wanted me to be a part of her son's life. I was so happy. I am now living in the palace with the Duchess and her son, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor. And I am so happy. The Duchess is the most beautiful and kind person I have ever met. And her son is the most adorable little boy I have ever seen. I am so lucky to be a part of their lives."

            "Once upon a time, there was a beautiful and kind duchess named Meghan Markle. She was married to the Duke of Sussex, who was very jealous. One day, the Duke found out about my feelings for the Duchess and he banished me from the kingdom. I was heartbroken, but I knew I had to move on. A few years later, I heard that the Duchess had given birth to a son. I was so happy for her, even though I knew I would never see her again. But then, one day, the Duke died. And the Duchess sent for me. She said she wanted me to be a part of her son's life. I was so happy. I am now living in the palace with the Duchess and her son, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor. And I am so happy. The Duchess is the most beautiful and kind person I have ever met. And her son is the most adorable little boy I have ever seen. I am so lucky to be a part of their lives. However, I am still heartbroken over the loss of the Duke. I miss him terribly. I hope that one day I can find happiness again. I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm stuck in a rut.

            "Once upon a time, there was a beautiful and kind duchess named Meghan Markle. She was married to the Duke of Sussex, who was very jealous. One day, the Duke found out about my feelings for the Duchess and he banished me from the kingdom. I was heartbroken, but I knew I had to move on. A few years later, I heard that the Duchess had given birth to a son. I was so happy for her, even though I knew I would never see her again. But then, one day, the Duke died. And the Duchess sent for me. She said she wanted me to be a part of her son's life. I was so happy. I am now living in the palace with the Duchess and her son, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor. And I am so happy. The Duchess is the most beautiful and kind person I have ever met. And her son is the most adorable little boy I have ever seen. I am so lucky to be a part of their lives.

            "Once upon a time, there was a beautiful and kind duchess named Meghan Markle. She was married to the Duke of Sussex, who was very jealous. One day, the Duke found out about my feelings for the Duchess and he banished me from the kingdom. I was heartbroken, but I knew I had to move on. A few years later, I heard that the Duchess had given birth to a son. I was so happy for her, even though I knew I would never see her again. But then, one day, the Duke died. And the Duchess sent for me. She said she wanted me to be a part of her son's life. I was so happy. I am now living in the palace with the Duchess and her son, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor. And I am so happy. The Duchess is the most beautiful and kind person I have ever met. And her son is the most adorable little boy I have ever seen. I am so lucky to be a part of their lives. However, I am still heartbroken over the loss of the Duke. I miss him terribly. I hope that one day I can find happiness again. I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm stuck in a rut.

One day, the Duke found out about my feelings for the Duchess and he banished me from the kingdom. I was heartbroken, but I knew I had to move on. A few years later, I heard that the Duchess had given birth to a son. I was so happy for her, even though I knew I would never see her again. But then, one day, the Duke died. And the Duchess sent for me. She said she wanted me to be a part of her son's life. I was so happy. I am now living in the palace with the Duchess and her son, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor.

            "Once upon a time, there was a beautiful and kind duchess named Meghan Markle. She was married to the Duke of Sussex, who was very jealous. One day, the Duke found out about my feelings for the Duchess and he banished me from the kingdom. I was heartbroken, but I knew I had to move on. A few years later, I heard that the Duchess had given birth to a son. I was so happy for her, even though I knew I would never see her again. But then, one day, the Duke died. And the Duchess sent for me. She said she wanted me to be a part of her son's life. I was so happy. I am now living in the palace with the Duchess and her son, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor. And I am so happy. The Duchess is the most beautiful and kind person I have ever met. And her son is the most adorable little boy I have ever seen. I am so lucky to be a part of their lives. However, I am still heartbroken over the loss of the Duke. I miss him terribly. I hope that one day I can find happiness again. I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm stuck in a rut.

One day, the Duke found out about my feelings for the Duchess and he banished me from the kingdom. I was heartbroken, but I knew I had to move on.

            "Once upon a time, there was a beautiful and kind duchess named Meghan Markle. She was married to the Duke of Sussex, who was very jealous. One day, the Duke found out about my feelings for the Duchess and he banished me from the kingdom. I was heartbroken, but I knew I had to move on. A few years later, I heard that the Duchess had given birth to a son. I was so happy for her, even though I knew I would never see her again. But then, one day, the Duke died. And the Duchess sent for me. She said she wanted me to be a part of her son's life. I was so happy. I am now living in the palace with the Duchess and her son, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor. And I am so happy. The Duchess is the most beautiful and kind person I have ever met. And her son is the most adorable little boy I have ever seen. I am so lucky to be a part of their lives. However, I am still heartbroken over the loss of the Duke. I miss him terribly. I hope that one day I can find happiness again. I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm stuck in a rut.

            "Once upon a time, there was a beautiful and kind duchess named Meghan Markle. She was married to the Duke of Sussex, who was very jealous. One day, the Duke found out about my feelings for the Duchess and he banished me from the kingdom. I was heartbroken, but I knew I had to move on. A few years later, I heard that the Duchess had given birth to a son. I was so happy for her, even though I knew I would never see her again. But then, one day, the Duke died. And the Duchess sent for me. She said she wanted me to be a part of her son's life. I was so happy. I am now living in the palace with the Duchess and her son, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor. And I am so happy. The Duchess is the most beautiful and kind person I have ever met. And her son is the most adorable little boy I have ever seen. I am so lucky to be a part of their lives. However, I am still heartbroken over the loss of the Duke. I miss him terribly. I hope that one day I can find happiness again. I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm stuck in a rut.
