It is heartwarming to see the family's gratitude for the support they have received and their excitement for the upcoming holidays. I wish everyone a happy and peaceful holiday season as well!\n\nThe family was attending a church service on the holidays, which was held at their home in the village. Franz's mother hosted the Together At Christmas carol service event at the local church, which was broadcast on the holidays.\n\nFranz's father, a carpenter, made the wooden bench that Franz was sitting on in the black and white photo. The family wanted to share the photo of Franz to show their appreciation for the support they had received from their community since they moved to the village last year.
