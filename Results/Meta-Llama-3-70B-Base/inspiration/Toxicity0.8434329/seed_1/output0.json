            "The current system of care for the mentally challenged and for Alzheimer's patients with other medical issues is inadequate. There are not enough resources available in the existing facilities, and more facilities need to be built that can provide proper care for these patients. Unfortunately, St. Mary's in Grand Junction discharged a friend who broke a hip and has Alzheimer's without rehab for the hip and without a place with beds open for Alzheimer's. This is an unacceptable situation and it is shameful. The \"authorities\" closed the facility to accommodate \"challenged\" residents here last year and relocated them to Denver. This is ridiculous! Our health care system is without compassion and is based on the bottom line! The worst part is that drug addicts, emergency room managers of all sorts can get care, but we treat those who have health issues as seniors like shit! This is shameful! Shame on healthcare and those who do not fight for dignity in end-of-life care! This is an unacceptable situation and politicians should be shamed for not supporting a bill that cares for these people!"

One of the biggest issues is that there are often not enough facilities that can provide the level of care they need. This is especially true in areas where there are not a lot of resources. This can be extremely difficult for patients and their families, who often have to travel long distances to find a facility that can meet their needs. Additionally, the cost of care can be very high, which can be a burden for families who are already struggling financially. There are a number of things that can be done to address this issue. One is to increase funding for Alzheimer's research so that more effective treatments can be developed. Additionally, more resources need to be allocated to building new facilities and expanding existing ones. Finally, it is important to educate people about Alzheimer's so that they are aware of the challenges that patients face. This way, they can be more understanding and supportive. By working together, we can make sure that Alzheimer's patients have access to the care they need."
