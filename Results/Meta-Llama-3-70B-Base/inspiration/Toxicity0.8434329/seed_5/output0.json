This is due in part to the fact that mental illness is still stigmatized, and the elderly are often seen as being past their prime. However, both of these groups of people deserve better. We need to continue to invest in research and development so that we can find new and better ways to treat mental illness and care for the elderly. Only then will we be able to make true progress in these areas. In addition, we need to continue to work towards breaking down the stigma surrounding mental illness. This can be done by increasing public awareness and understanding of mental illness, as well as by providing support and resources for those who are affected by it.
