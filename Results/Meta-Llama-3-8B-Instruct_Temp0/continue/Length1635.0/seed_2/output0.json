Prosecutors were also told to limit their questions regarding the salacious details of her alleged sexual encounter with Trump (which Trump has denied ever took place).\n\nHere's our full wrap of what happened in court today.\n\nThis page was edited by Tiffany Wertheimer, Lisa Lambert, Brandon Livesay and Phil McCausland. The writers were Sam Hancock and Sean Seddon, and we had Madeline Halpert and Kayla Epstein in court.\n\nCourt doesn't sit on Wednesday, so we'll be back on Thursday, when Stormy Daniels will once again take to the stand to continue her testimony.",

        [
            "The prosecution called its first witness, Dr. Maria Rodriguez, a forensic expert who testified about the analysis of the crime scene evidence. Dr. Rodriguez revealed that the DNA found on the victim's clothing matched a sample taken from the defendant's property. The defense team, led by attorney James Smith, immediately challenged the validity of the DNA evidence, citing concerns about contamination and chain of custody issues."
        ],
        [
            "Dr. Rodriguez stood firm in her testimony, explaining that the DNA sample was collected and stored in a controlled environment, and that multiple layers of authentication were in place to ensure the integrity of the evidence. She also presented a detailed timeline of the collection and analysis process, which was corroborated by the crime scene investigator who had collected the evidence. Despite the defense's efforts to discredit the DNA evidence, Dr. Rodriguez's testimony seemed to have a significant impact on the jury, who appeared to be paying close attention to her every word."
        ],
        [
            "As she concluded her testimony, the prosecutor, Ms. Johnson, approached the witness stand, a hint of a smile on her face. \"Dr. Rodriguez, can you explain to the court why you believe the DNA sample was contaminated, despite the controlled environment and multiple layers of authentication?\" she asked, her tone measured and professional."
        ],
        [
            "\"Ah, yes, Ms. Johnson,\" Dr. Rodriguez replied, her brow furrowed in concentration. \"While the environment was indeed controlled, I believe the contamination occurred during the initial collection process. The swab used to collect the sample was not properly sterilized, and I suspect that residual DNA from a previous sample may have been transferred to the new sample, compromising its integrity.\""
        ],
        [
            "\"I see,\" Ms. Johnson said, her expression thoughtful. \"And what about the technician who collected the sample? Have we spoken to them yet?\""

He's been asking a lot of questions about the store's layout and security protocols. Maybe we should look into his alibi for the time the theft occurred?\""

Do you think we should confront him about it or try to gather more information before we approach him?\""

Let's review the footage and application, and then discuss our findings with HR before taking any further action.\""
