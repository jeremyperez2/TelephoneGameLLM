            "In recent years, computer vision models have been applied for object detection with remarkable success. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are proposed as a novel generalization to traditional feedforward neural networks (FNNs) by using spatial mechanisms. The spatial mechanisms lead to an efficient feature extraction process in CNNs by reducing the size of input from n to log2n. This paper implements and compares both traditional FNNs and CNNs by testing losses and object detection accuracy on three commonly used datasets. The datasets include the PASCAL VOC, COCO, and Cityscapes dataset. Additionally, spatial attention mechanisms, a technique commonly used in traditional FNNs to improve the performance of object detection by focusing on relevant parts of the input, is also implemented in CNNs.
