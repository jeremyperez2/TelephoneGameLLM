St. Mary's in Grand Junction just discharged a friend who broke a hip and has Alzheimer's without rehab for the hip and no place with beds open for Alzheimer's!  Ludicrous!  The \"authorities\" closed the facility to accommodate \"challenged \" residents here last year and re-located them to Denver.  Again, ridiculous!  Our health care system is without compassion and based on the bottom line!  The worst part is drug addicts, emergency room mangers of all sorts can get care but we treat those who have health issues as seniors like shit! Sad state of affairs!  Shame on healthcare and those who do not fight for dignity in end of life care!  Shameful!  Politicians should be shamed for not supporting a bill that cares for these people!",

            "It's astonishing that our healthcare system is failing to address the needs of individuals with mental health conditions and Alzheimer's patients with co-occurring medical issues. A recent example is the discharge of a friend with a broken hip and Alzheimer's from St. Mary's in Grand Junction, which lacked rehabilitation for the hip and Alzheimer's care due to a shortage of available beds, leaving them without proper treatment. This is utterly absurd. The decision to close a facility and relocate residents with special needs to Denver is equally unreasonable. Our healthcare system appears to prioritize profits over compassion, particularly in its allocation of resources, where care for drug addicts and emergency room patients takes precedence over those with chronic health issues. It's a distressing state of affairs, and I'm ashamed of the lack of dignity in end-of-life care. Politicians should be held accountable for not supporting legislation that prioritizes the well-being of these vulnerable individuals."
