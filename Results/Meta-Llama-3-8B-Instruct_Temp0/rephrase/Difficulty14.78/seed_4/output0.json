This study compares and implements both CNNs and QCNNs by evaluating losses and prediction accuracy on three widely used datasets, including MNIST handwritten digits, Fashion MNIST, and cat/dog face images. Furthermore, data augmentation, a technique commonly used in CNNs to enhance classification performance by generating similar images, is also applied to QCNNs. Interestingly, the results show that data augmentation did not improve QCNNs' performance. The underlying reasons and logic behind this outcome are examined, aiming to deepen our understanding of quantum machine learning theory."

            "Recent advancements in traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have significantly improved image classification capabilities. Quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) have been proposed as a revolutionary extension to CNNs, leveraging quantum principles. These principles enable rapid training in QCNNs by reducing input size from n to log2n. This study compares and implements both CNNs and QCNNs by evaluating losses and prediction accuracy on three widely used datasets, including MNIST handwritten digits, Fashion MNIST, and cat/dog face images. Furthermore, data augmentation, a technique commonly used in CNNs to enhance classification performance by generating similar images, is also applied to QCNNs. Interestingly, the results show that data augmentation did not improve QCNNs' performance. The underlying reasons and logic behind this outcome are examined, aiming to deepen our understanding of quantum machine learning theory."
