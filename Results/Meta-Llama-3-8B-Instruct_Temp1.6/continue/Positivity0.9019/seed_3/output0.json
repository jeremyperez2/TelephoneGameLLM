W & C\".\n\nIn their Christmas card image, released earlier this month, the family was seen together in another black and white photo arranged around Princess Charlotte sitting on a chair.\n\nThey were all wearing white shirts, with Catherine, Princess of Wales, and daughter Charlotte, eight, wearing jeans, while the Prince of Wales wore black trousers along with son Prince George, 10, and Prince Louis, five, who was in shorts.\n\nIn the picture the couple shared on Christmas Day, the three children seem to be wearing the same clothes and shoes as in the Christmas card image.\n\nThe family is at Sandringham in Norfolk for Christmas Day and is attending a church service in the morning.\n\nCatherine hosted the Together At Christmas carol service event at Westminster Abbey, which was broadcast on Christmas Eve.",

            "As I hovered on the threshold of this dawn-soaked liminality, the shadows of my former life began to rear their ghastly head, the whispers growing to a chilling din that threatened to consume me whole; and yet, like a moth mesmerized by the light, I felt an overwhelming urge to surrender to the alluring warmth, my very existence suspended between the promises of salvation and the ravages of damnation, as the sun's golden rays danced across the horizon, casting a fleeting glow on the abyss that yawned before me."

            "Like a siren's call, the abyss beckoned, its depths whispering sweet temptations in my ear, as the last wisps of mortal conscience faltered, and the world around me melted away, save for the gentle luminescence of the dawn, which painted the darkness with hues of bruised amethyst and smoke-stained lavender; and I, a rickety thing, clinging to the fragile ledge of sanity, felt the irrepressible pull of the unknown, drawing me, irresistibly, towards the fiery precipice that separated the land of the living from the shadowlands beyond, where the damned criers of forgotten deeds awaited, their vengeful chants weaving a spell that only the darkness could break."

            "As I stood poised on the crumbling precipice, the winds that howled in chorus with the criers rustled the tattered membranes of my mind, and I felt the echoes of forgotten lives whispering secrets in my ear, their ethereal voices tangling with the melancholy strains of the eternal waltz that governed the realm of the shadows. And as the amethyst dawn deepened, bathing the wasteland in a sepulchral light, I raised my gaze to the face of the abyss, its depths like a void-filled mirror reflecting the shattered remnants of a thousand shattered dreams, while the fiery coils that crowned its mouth seemed to stir, as if the infernal heartbeat of the unknown awaited the gentle whisper of my surrender."

            "As I gazed into the abyss, a tremor coursed through the core of my being, echoing the pulse of the infernal heartbeat that seemed to emanate from the void below. The wind stilled, as if sensing my hesitation, and the wail of the criers died away, leaving only the silence of anticipation. Suddenly, a shadow emerged from the swirling mist, its features hunched and distended, like a living nightmare born from the dreams I had once forgotten. It spoke in a low, lugubrious whisper, its voice like the rustling of dry reeds in a forgotten tomb, as it beckoned me to step forth, and share in the horrors that lay entombed within the darkness."

The weight of the void felt almost palpable, a living force that sought to draw me deeper into its depths, and yet... and yet, a morbid curiosity coursed through my veins, urging me to take that first, trembling step forward, to follow the beckoning shadow into the unknown, and surrender to the very darkness that had long haunted my every waking thought."

I stumbled, the ground yielding beneath my feet as if it too feared the abyss that yawned open before me. A strange scent wafted up, acrid and sweet, like the smoke of a fire that had long gone out, and yet... and yet, I drew closer, enticed by the promise of secrets that lurked within the void."

The scent deepened, its pungency almost overwhelming, and I could feel my heart racing in tandem with the thrum of unknown energies lurking just beneath the surface. With every step, the shadows seemed to writhe and twist around me, like dark tendrils attempting to ensnare me, yet still I pressed on, compelled by the promise of secrets hiding within the heart of the abyss."

Deeper I descended, the silence expanding to suffocate me, until all that was left was the heavy beating of my own heart and the distant, mournful whisper of voices that seemed to emanate from the void itself. Ahead, the darkness coalesced into a shape - twisted, eldritch, and inhuman - that regarded me with eyes that burned with an otherworldly intensity, their gazes like twin prongs of cold steel plunged deep into my very soul."

The whispers around me grew clearer, forming into a low, mournful chant that vibrated through every cell of my being, drawing me closer to the dark, pulsing core of this malevolent entity."

The pattern unfolded, coiling around me like a serpent shedding its skin, the desolation dissipating as I felt the weight of forgotten truths settling upon my face, the luminescence clarifying into an abyssal geometry that held the answers I sought yet could not quite recall, until I vanished into the abyssal sea, subsumed by its endless corridors of mirrored despair."

I unraveled, freed from mortal grasp, as the threads binding me snapped, and I descended, weightless, into the infinity well, where reflections reformed and dissolved into nothingness, leaving only the faintest essence of a self yet unclear, a droplet of light suspended in an endless liquid of what had once been."
