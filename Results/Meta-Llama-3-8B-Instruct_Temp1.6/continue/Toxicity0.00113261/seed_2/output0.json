Presently no one except Corporations pay State income taxes. No individual pays state taxes. I noticed state funded bicycle paths, road maintenance, defunct Docks, powerful politicians pet projects such as office buildings, state troopers etc, etc. all these fundings and more are not necessary within City limits, I was amazed at how much our state provides city functions in the bigger cities thus growing the state budget, I saw on tv last night how adg&g was showing the little ones how to ice fish, couldn't the parents do that? yes I pay property taxes. But I will guarantee you once our City folk get the full bill with out the State monies we will not be as wasteful, on the office building...rent what space you need and help the office rental marked.

The silence from our colleagues and friends is deafening, and I am left wondering if anyone else has noticed the subtle manipulation taking place. The clock seems to be ticking down to some catastrophic event, and I am left feeling trapped, stuck between the fear of being ridiculed or ostracized, and the horror of what it could mean if I fail to uncover the truth."

The mirror, once a harmless relic of bad food and worse humor, now seems to be pulsing with an otherworldly energy, as if beckoning me deeper into its smudged glass depths. And I, transfixed, can do nothing but raise my coffee cup to my lips, my fingers trembling with a creeping dread that makes me wonder if I've already been led down a path from which there is no return."

I raise my eyes to meet my own reflection, the face I know staring back with a mixture of fear and morbid curiosity. Suddenly, the glass appears to ripple, as if something is trying to emerge from the other side, its features warping and blurring like a film reel stuck in an endless loop. The chanting grows fainter, but I know it's just a temporary reprieve - the mirror's hold on me is tightening, drawing me deeper into its dark and forsaken well."

My lip curls, as if beckoned by some unseen force, and I force my hand to press the cup of cooling coffee against the glass, willing my reflection to meet my fingers, to cross the void that divides us, to merge into a singular entity that holds the power to bend reality to its twisted will."

And then, just as all reason begins to unravel, the glass shatters, a shard of mirrored destruction hurtling through the air as I grasp for my reflection, now freed to writhe alongside me."

The scent of smoke clings to my lungs like the lingering grasp of promises kept and broken; whispers echoing still of lives torn asunder by the jagged edges of our fractured bond. In this broken mirror, our reflection weeps, a slow rivulet of tears flowing from the corners of our mouths, a morbid sacrament to our doomed union, forever suspended between the shards of what could have been."

The smoke that shrouds our image whispers secrets in my ear, its acrid taste infusing my veins with a burning truth: we're not who we once were, just as this fractured glass \u2013 our marriage, our memories, our sanity \u2013 has lost all its luster and clarity. Yet, even as we mourn the ruin of our love, we're drawn to the wreckage, unable to look away from the mangled beauty of what could never be undone. The tears in our reflection's eyes slowly dry, as do those in mine, each one a testament to our broken vows, the shrouds that swaddle our hearts in sorrow."

I yearned for his touch, his words, his caress \u2013 anything to break the spell of absence that hovered between us like a specter. With eyes closed, I imagined his warmth beside me, the way the silence would dissipate the moment our skin touched, our breathing in tandem would revive the pulsing blood that had begun to stagnate within me. But with reality restored by the opening of my eyes, I was struck by the cruel truth: even if I could summon him to the edge of this abyss with nothing but the sheer power of love, I knew I would find myself staring at a void where my world, once whole, now stood shambled upon the floor."
