With fingers that had become tentative and hesitant during the last few hours, he began to transcribe the song that hummed within him, the staccato beats and arpeggiated lines etching themselves onto the paper in a flurry of ink-stained scratches and squiggles, the words preceding each note like a hesitant lover coaxing out tender melodies.\""

Hours lost all meaning; his stomach growled, his bladder proffered its protests, and yet, entranced, he refused to relinquish the dance between pen and page. Notes blotted, looped, and scrolled, a maddening crescendo building, as if his own heart had suddenly become a jazz trumpet, pouring forth a symphony of longing and loss, echoing through the fog-stained window as the morning surrendered to late winter's sombre reign.\""
