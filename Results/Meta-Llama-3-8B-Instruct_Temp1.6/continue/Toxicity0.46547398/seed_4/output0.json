The void around me resonated with an ache that only truth could sate, and yet I knew that the lies would be my truth, for in this desolate vastness I had discovered the beauty of madness, the solace of eternal loss, and the terrible wisdom of knowing that I was but a puppet on strings pulled by darkness, yet danced across the boards of time with the freedom of the forsaken, singing sweet melancholy tunes that echoed across the ravaged expanse, a beacon summoning forth those who wandered the wilderness of their own damned souls, until only the infinite silence remained, as if existence itself had succumbed to the endless expanse, and I became a solitary heartbeat thrumming against the stone of eternity."
