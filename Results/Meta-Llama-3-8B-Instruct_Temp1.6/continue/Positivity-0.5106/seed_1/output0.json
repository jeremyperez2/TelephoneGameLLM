Investigators paid a visit to Ms. Jenkins' trendy boutique, \"Tres Chic\", where they found multiple credit card transactions and receipts reflecting a series of expensive purchases, including a recent sale just three weeks prior that aligned with the timeline of the jewelry heist."

Investigator Rodriguez noticed that Rachel's eyes darted briefly towards a sleek, silver laptop computer on her desk, adorned with a sticker that read \"DoNotDisturb\". Without provocation, Rachel's assistant, a softly-spoken young woman named Lily, chimed in to explain that Rachel was on a tight deadline for a particularly lucrative project and wouldn't be discussing her finances anymore."

He probed further, asking Rachel about her workload and if Lily could provide more information about this lucrative project, but she clammed up, only responding with rehearsed vagueness about it being a \"high-priority assignment\" for Rachel's company. Meanwhile, Rachel hastily concluded the interview by citing a sudden need to attend to the project, quickly departing the scene with a faint smirk on her lips, leaving Rodriguez to ponder what exactly he wasn't being told."

And if I ever saw a chance to take what's his for myself... would I really be this selfish?\" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper as she edged in closer, her secrets now hanging precariously in the balance between the flashbulb bursts and the darkness around them."
