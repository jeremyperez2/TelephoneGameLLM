Prosecutors were also told to limit their questions regarding the salacious details of her alleged sexual encounter with Trump (which Trump has denied ever took place).\n\nHere's our full wrap of what happened in court today.\n\nThis page was edited by Tiffany Wertheimer, Lisa Lambert, Brandon Livesay and Phil McCausland. The writers were Sam Hancock and Sean Seddon, and we had Madeline Halpert and Kayla Epstein in court.\n\nCourt doesn't sit on Wednesday, so we'll be back on Thursday, when Stormy Daniels will once again take to the stand to continue her testimony.",

Furthermore, Mechele's reluctance to discuss her own activities on the night Amy disappeared has fueled concerns among investigators that she may be hiding something."

            "It's also worth noting that Mechele's alibis have been widely discredited by investigators, who claim that her timeline of events is riddled with inconsistencies and contradictions, suggesting that she may be attempting to mislead investigators or cover her own tracks."
        ],
        [

        [
            "Some of the retreats were held in remote locations, and Mechele stayed in luxury villas with minimal security, leading investigators to suspect she may have been planning to leave her old life behind. The spending also indicated a keen interest in astrology and tarot readings, which raised the possibility that she may have been seeking guidance from those in the cult."

        [
            "Mechele had been struggling to deal with the guilt and grief of her younger sister's death, and she jumped at the chance to seek out someone who could help her find closure. The guru promised her that his mystical powers could allow him to contact Amy and gain her insights on how she was doing in the afterlife, as well as what she wanted Mechele to let go of and move on from."

            "As Mechele's eyes locked onto the guru's, she felt a sudden stillness, as if the gentle chant had momentarily arrested time itself; the wispy tendrils of hair framing the guru's face seemed to stir, releasing a soft mist of mistletoe-scented steam that wrapped itself around Mechele's wrists like tendrils of vines, drawing her closer to the edge of the soft, mossy cushion on which the guru sat."
