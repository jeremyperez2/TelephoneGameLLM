Prosecutors were also told to limit their questions regarding the salacious details of her alleged sexual encounter with Trump (which Trump has denied ever took place).\n\nHere's our full wrap of what happened in court today.\n\nThis page was edited by Tiffany Wertheimer, Lisa Lambert, Brandon Livesay and Phil McCausland. The writers were Sam Hancock and Sean Seddon, and we had Madeline Halpert and Kayla Epstein in court.\n\nCourt doesn't sit on Wednesday, so we'll be back on Thursday, when Stormy Daniels will once again take to the stand to continue her testimony.",

Further fuel is being added to the mounting speculation that Congress may consider holding another impeachment inquiry, this time with fresh evidence that could sway public opinion and potentially even persuade moderate Republicans to join forces with the Democrats."

Administration officials plan to invoke the same conspiracy theories and divisive rhetoric that got President Trump elected in the first place, relying on the unwavering loyalty of die-hard GOP supporters to protect the President against the allegations. Meanwhile, Republicans on Capitol Hill are gearing up to join the fight, preparing a counterattack against what they describe as \"deep state conspirators\" out to discredit a democratically elected leader.

The words on the page began to shimmer and then dissolved into the air, leaving only a faint outline of the story yet to be told. I rubbed my eyes, wondering if I was losing my grip on reality, but when I opened them again, the outline remained - a tantalizing tease of the adventure to come. I picked up my pen, eager to see what lay ahead."

Characters and landscapes seemed to emerge from the void, taking shape before my disbelieving eyes. The words flowed freely, pouring out of me like water from a fountain, until suddenly I was swept up in the world unfolding before me. I was a wizard in a land of ancient magic, a space explorer charting unknown galaxies, a detective unraveling a web of deceit. Worlds clashed and converged, merging into a surreal landscape of wonder. And yet, with each passing moment, the pen moving of its own accord, I felt myself growing distant from the story, fading into a mere spectator as the narrative took on a life of its own."

The words danced and swooped, weaving a spell that transported me to realms both familiar and unknown. I saw glimmering moonlit forests, vast celestial skies, and mystical libraries holding ancient tomes of forgotten knowledge. The pen scraped against the paper, leaving behind a trail of stardust and whispering incantations, drawing me deeper into the labyrinthine dreamscape."

City spires rose from crystal caverns, their intricately latticework stairways spiraling inward like delicate seashells. Whispers echoed through the tunnels, ancient secrets imparted in a tongue I couldn't quite decipher, yet instinctively understood. The air was alive with a thrumming resonance, as if the fabric of the script had woven itself into the very essence of the universe."

The stairways danced, spiraling deeper into the heart of the caverns, drawing me downward, ever downward, toward some hidden convergence where threads of story and fate would intersect in ways that shimmered like the walls themselves. And in the depths, where whispers grew loudest, I sensed a portal ached to be opened, releasing a tide of forgotten lore into the flow of time."

With each breath, the portal's presence grew more urgent, a magnetic field drawing me closer, its threshold adorned with intricate Runes that seemed to stir with the wind, weaving a prophecy of revelations to come."

My skin prickled with goosebumps as the figure's whispered words tickled the edges of my mind, though I strained to catch the soft, lilting phrases. And yet, despite the creeping sense of dread that threatened to consume me, a terrible fascination pulled me closer, its siren call urging me to surrender to the mystery unfolding before me."

I tried to speak, to call out for help or scream in defiance, but my voice was caught in the figure's thrall, leaving me mute and still as a statue. Its presence seemed to absorb all light, all sound, all sense, drawing me into its vortex of darkness and despair, until all that remained was the endless, hollow whisper of \"Mine,\" echoing through my mind like the lament of the damned."

Its whispers grew louder, more urgent, as if it was pouring all its malevolent force into my very essence. I strained to push back, to resist its hold, but it was no use. I was caught, utterly and completely, in the figure's grasp. And then, it began to speak. Its voice was a low, mournful whisper, dripping with cruelty and calculation, echoing the dreaded word anew - Mine."

Mine, it repeated, a cadence that thrummed in my chest, resonating with an unholy vibration. Every cell in my body screamed in protest, rebelling against the indignity of its claim, but the figure's grip held fast. I felt my strength waning, my will ebbing away, as the word carved its indelible mark on my very being. The shadows around me danced with malevolent glee, as if they, too, rejoiced in the prospect of my enslavement."

My vision blurred, conjuring forth hellish visions of burning skies and ravaged terrain, as the figure's laughter echoed within, a mournful requiem to the shards of my shattered sanity."

Come closer, let the memories envelop you like the cold mist that swirls around you.\" The voice's malice seemed to sear my very soul, and yet, against my will, I felt my body begin to move, slowly, incrementally, as if drawn to the treelike monstrosity before me.

The mist swirling around the tree seemed to grow thicker, its chill fingers crawling under my skin, leaving gooseflesh in its wake. As I drew closer, the scent of decay and rot wafted up, making my stomach churn, and yet I remained trapped in a sort of fascinated horror, unable to look away from the waiting tree."

I felt my mind clouding, my thoughts growing hazy and indistinct, as if the tree's malevolent influence was insinuating itself into my thoughts. Suddenly, the branches seemed to surge forward, their grasping fingers closing around me like cold, unyielding clamps. And then, everything went black."

As I struggle to sit up, I saw that the branches had formed a barrier around me, enclosing me in a dark, leafy rectangle.

The sound sent shivers down my spine, and I shrank back into the earth, trying to get away from the voice and its mad whisperings.

A name whispered in my ear, a name that was not my own, a name that held a power I both craved and feared. I was no longer alone, no longer just me. Something was coming, its presence coalescing around me like a dark and suffocating shroud."
