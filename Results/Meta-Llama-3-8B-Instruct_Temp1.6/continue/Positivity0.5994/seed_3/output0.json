And then, I see the others.

Eyes, black as oil slicks, lock onto mine, their milky white veils glistening in the dim light, as if drained of all vital energy; yet, amidst the desolation, a spark of something akin to recognition flickers within their hollows, drawing me nearer to this ashen apparition's sepulchral whisper: 'The final count.' Its dry lips part to utter the words once more, leaving a faint tang of formaldehyde on the air, and though it seems an improbable thing, I find myself wanting to know the numbers \u2013 how few are we, truly \u2013 and whether any might yet escape the relentless tallying of the unknown, beyond the broken gates of this forsaken station, where night itself has become a door through which they continue to seep, like oil from a cracked seal.\""

How many more, like me, are trapped within this nightmarish limbo, counting down with each dying breath?

For in those eyes, like black wells without bottom, I saw not only the count of the damned but also a mirrored reflection of my own tormented soul: a countdown to oblivion, each number etched in scarlet upon the stone of my conscience.
