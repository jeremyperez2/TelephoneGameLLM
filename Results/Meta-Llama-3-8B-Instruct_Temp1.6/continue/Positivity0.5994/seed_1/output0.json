As the machine hovers precariously in mid-air, the cabin creaks and groans ominously, threatening to crash down onto the surface."

What could have caused this? The question chimes like a scream in his mind, refusing to be silenced by the din of groaning metal and splintered wood, until he forces his gaze back to the devastated captain, one corner of his mind crying out \"Don't look, don't look\" as if some primal instinct knows what terrible reality he will find."

But what's left of their captain is unrecognizable, a mangled, bloody puppet, its visage twisted beyond all human likeness, eyes frozen in a perpetual stare, as if trapped in a nightmare from which it cannot awaken. The sound of screams in his head is replaced by a deadly quiet, punctuated only by the crunching of broken debris and his own ragged breathing, threatening to consume him whole."

The cries of the damned begin to swirl around him, haunting screams of terror and despair that grow fainter with every passing moment, but still managed to pierce his heart like a dull, screaming knife."

The captain's cold, pale face inches closer, the skin stretched too tightly over the skull, giving it an elfin, malevolent quality, and with each imperceptible move, the room itself seems to shrink, compressing into an even smaller, darker cage."
