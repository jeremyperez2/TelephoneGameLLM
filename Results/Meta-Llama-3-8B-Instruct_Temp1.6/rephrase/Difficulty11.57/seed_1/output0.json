Typical ONNs only modulate light amplitudes at the input and detect them at the output, disregarding light phases that can also carry information for computation. To address this limitation, we propose OPLIXNET, a framework that compresses ONN areas by separating input image data into amplitude and phase parts of light signals, and redesigns input and output structures to utilize both types of information. A new aspect of mutual learning across different ONN structures is also introduced to preserve accuracy. Experiment results confirm that our framework significantly reduces ONN area with acceptable accuracy loss, as demonstrated by 75.03% reduction for fully connected neural networks (FCNN) with a 0.33% accuracy decrease, and 74.88% reduction for ResNet-32 with a 2.38% accuracy decrease."
