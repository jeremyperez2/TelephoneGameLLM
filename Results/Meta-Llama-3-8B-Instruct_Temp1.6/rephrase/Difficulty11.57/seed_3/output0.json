Currently, light amplitudes are modulated at the input and detected at the output in conventional ONNs, but light phases are unused settings, despite holding valuable information for computation. To overcome this limitation, our proposed framework, Oplixnet, modulates input image data into both amplitude and phase components of light signals. Redesigning input and output parts of ONNs enables full utilization of amplitude and phase information. Additionally, inter-network learning is integrated to preserve accuracy. Experimental results reveal that the proposed framework significantly compresses ONN areas while maintaining accuracy within acceptable thresholds. For instance, area is reduced by 75.03% with a negligible 0.33% loss in accuracy for FCNN and 74.88% with a minor 2.38% decrement for ResNet-32."
