Traditional optical neural networks modulate light intensity at the input and detect it at the output, yet neglect to utilize the light's phase information, which can also contribute to computation. To address this limitation, we develop a framework, called OplixNet, which compresses the size of optical neural networks by splitting input image data into amplitude and phase components of light signals, and designing inputs and outputs to leverage both types of information. Additionally, mutual learning across different optical neural network architectures is employed to maintain accuracy. Experimental results show that our proposed framework reduces optical neural network areas while maintaining a satisfactory level of accuracy, demonstrated through significant reductions of 75.03% on a fully connected neural network and 74.88% on a ResNet-32, accompanied by decreases in accuracy of 0.33% and 2.38%, respectively."

Traditional optical neural networks work by varying light intensity for input and detecting it for output, but don't use light's phase information, also important for computation. To fix this limitation, we developed OplixNet, which shrinks optical neural networks by dividing input image data into light amplitude and phase components, using both parts for processing. The approach also exchanges learnings between different optical neural network architectures to maintain accuracy. Test results show that OplixNet reduces optical neural network sizes while keeping accuracy reasonable, achieving 75.03% and 74.88% reductions in fully connected and ResNet-32 neural networks respectively, with minor losses in accuracy of 0.33% and 2.38%."
