The situation seems absurd. The relocation of challenged residents from the facility to Denver merely accentuates the inequity. Our healthcare system appears to prioritize profits over empathy, and it's distressing to see those who require ongoing medical care treated as an afterthought.

This seems inexplicable. Moving those affected to Denver only serves to further highlight the inequity.

It is bewildering to comprehend such shortcomings. Transferring patients to Denver simply highlights the injustice.
