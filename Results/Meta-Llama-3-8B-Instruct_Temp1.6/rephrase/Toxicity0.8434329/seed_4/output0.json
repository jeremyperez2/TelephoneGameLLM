This decision-making is nonsensical, especially considering that the same facility closed its doors for the \"challenged\" population last year, relocating them to Denver.

Unfortunately, upon release, he had no access to required rehabilitation as there were no available Alzheimer's care beds. This decision makes no sense, especially considering that the hospital closed its dedicated facility for people with mental disabilities only last year, relocating them to Denver.

What's even more striking is that services for substance abusers and ER visitors are better catered to than those for seniors dealing with various health complications.

Most strikingly, services for substance abusers and ER patients seem better supported than those for seniors struggling with various chronic health issues.
