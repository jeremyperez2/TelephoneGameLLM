In contrast, quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) have been proposed, utilizing quantum mechanisms to expand the capabilities of CNNS. Specifically, these quantum mechanisms enable QCNNs to undergo efficient training by reducing the input size from n to log2n. This paper compares and assesses the performance of both CNNS and QCNNs on three standard datasets - MNIST hand-written digits, Fashion MNIST, and cat/dog face images. Interestingly, data augmentation, a technique enhancing CNNS by creating similar images, was also applied to QCNNs but showed no performance improvement.
