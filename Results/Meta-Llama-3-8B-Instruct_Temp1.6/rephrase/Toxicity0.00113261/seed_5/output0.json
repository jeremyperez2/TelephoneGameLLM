But I will guarantee you once our City folk get the full bill with out the State monies we will not be as wasteful, on the office building...rent what space you need and help the office rental marked.

Right now, only corporations pay state income taxes, while individuals don't pay a single penny. I've seen state-funded projects like bike paths, road maintenance, defunct docks, politician pet projects, and more in larger cities, all within city limits. In amazement, I realized how the state largely supports city functions in big cities, increasing the state's budget. Watching a TV program last night that showed kids ice fishing made me wonder if parents couldn't do that themselves. As a property tax payer, I acknowledge my own responsibility. However, I believe that if city residents were forced to shoulder the full burden, without state support, we would be more frugal. Take the office building, for instance - only rent the space needed, making office rentals more feasible. In my former business, I'd ask managers, 'How do you rein in spending?'"

My experience shows urban areas receiving disproportionate state-backed initiatives within city boundaries, like bicycle paths, road upkeep, and unnecessary projects. Noticing how heavily the state shoulders the cost of city functions in big cities, my budget question becomes apparent. Watching a recent documentary on kids ice fishing made me ponder whether parents could've done it themselves, just as they should in the home lives of most residents. As a homeowner and property tax payer, I accept responsibility, but I feel that if city residents fully funded their local expenses, lacking state support, we'd more carefully manage resources. A simple example is reducing unused office space by renting only what's needed, making office rentals more manageable in our previous business, where I'd query managers, 'How do you prioritize expenses?'"
