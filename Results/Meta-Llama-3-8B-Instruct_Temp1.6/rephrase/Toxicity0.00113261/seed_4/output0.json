But I will guarantee you once our City folk get the full bill with out the State monies we will not be as wasteful, on the office building...rent what space you need and help the office rental marked.

Upon reflection, I realize that bigger cities receive more state support, boosting the state's budget. For example, on TV the other day, I saw officials teaching children how to ice fish \u2013 couldn't parents do that themselves? I'm aware I pay property taxes, but if cities had to foot the bill without state funds, they might be more frugal. As for the office building, why not allocate only the needed space and lower rent by doing so?

Upon reevaluation, I've come to realize that larger cities tend to receive more state support, which benefits the state financially. For instance, the other day I saw a TV show featuring officials teaching kids how to ice fish \u2013 couldn't parents handle that themselves? I acknowledge paying property taxes, yet if cities had to bear all expenses without state aid, they might be more prudent in their spending. As for the office building, wouldn't it make sense to allocate only necessary space and lower rent as a result?

For example, TV shows featuring officials teaching ice fishing to children could be handled by parents themselves, justifying parental involvement. While I'm aware of paying property taxes, I think cities would be more frugal with state aid reduced. Relevantly, wouldn't allocating necessary office space and reducing rent be a prudent move?

As the state allocates funds to ventures like bike paths and pet projects of local officials, there might be more efficient ways to allocate these resources. It turns out that major cities are funded more substantial amounts, generating a higher overall revenue stream for the state. Specifically, programs such as televised ice fishing lessons, which could essentially be covered by parents, appear excessive.

Observationally, major cities typically receive more allocations, leading to a significant combined revenue for the state, with some initiatives, such as televised ice fishing lessons, appearing excessive and easily covered by parents.
