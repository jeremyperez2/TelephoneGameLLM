I noticed state funded bicycle paths, road maintenance, defunct Docks, powerful politicians pet projects such as office buildings, state troopers etc, etc. all these fundings and more are not necessary within City limits, I was amazed at how much our state provides city functions in the bigger cities thus growing the state budget, I saw on tv last night how adg&g was showing the little ones how to ice fish, couldn't the parents do that? yes I pay property taxes. But I will guarantee you once our City folk get the full bill with out the State monies we will not be as wasteful, on the office building...rent what space you need and help the office rental marked.

It's observed that only corporations pay state income taxes, whereas individuals don't. Note how state funds go towards ventures like bicycle paths, road maintenance, and government projects, all of which are superfluous within city limits. Our state provides numerous services to larger cities, swelling its budget. Recently, I saw a TV program showing children how to ice fish, and it occurred to me that their parents could handle it.

The allocation of state funds is heavily skewed towards public works like bicycle paths, road maintenance, and government projects, making them excessive within urban areas. Our state provides many services to larger cities, bolstering its budget. Watching a documentary about teaching children to ice fish reminded me that their parents could handle such responsibilities.

Additionally, funds are disproportionately allocated to public infrastructure in urban areas, prioritizing initiatives like bicycle paths, road upkeep, and government schemes. As our state provides many services to larger cities, their budgets greatly benefit. A documentary about adult responsibilities, such as ice fishing for children, inspired me to think that residents themselves should manage their expenses as well as taxpayer-funded initiatives.

Given that our state delivers various services to larger cities, their budgets substantially benefit. A documentary that emphasized adult responsibilities, like encouraging responsible child behavior through activities like ice fishing, motivated me to think that individuals should equally control their own expenses.

Given that our state provides various services to larger cities, their budgets therefore disproportionately benefit. A documentary about personal accountability, such as encouraging responsible parenting through activities like ice fishing, prompted me to think that individuals should bear personal financial burdens.

Since our state provides various services to larger cities, their budgets correspondingly benefit from this unfair disparity. Watching a documentary on personal responsibility, I was reminded that individuals should be responsible for their financial burdens.

Since our state provides services to larger cities, these populations disproportionately benefit from this unfair disparity.
