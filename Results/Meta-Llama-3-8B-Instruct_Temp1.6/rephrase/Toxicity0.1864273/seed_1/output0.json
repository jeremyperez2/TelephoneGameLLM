Just as they are trying to censor this brilliant and refreshing documentary on Dr. Zucker, (I'd encourage you to look into this heroic professional who was black listed by these career, taxpayer bleeding, social justice warriors and militant activists), they did the same thing with the Ontario Sex Ed curriculum.  They banned any parental feedback and deferred to the activist themselves to review it and approve it, despite the fact that it heavily promotes gender diasphora, and the fantasies of Ben Levin.\n\nThese totalitarians operate under the guise of gaining equality for a supposed marginalized group, but are willing to go scorched earth with your children to get what they want.  If you don't go along you're branded a homophobe or ignorant, but ask them for any scientific evidence and they'll trot out some junk science and personally attack you.",

This mirrors their actions regarding the Ontario Sex Ed curriculum, where they disavowed parental feedback, relying solely on activist endorsement, even when promoting problematic gender concepts and fantasies of Ben Levin. By claiming to defend a marginalised group, these authoritarians instead wreak havoc on children, labelling non-compliers as insensitive or close-minded. Their assertions of sound evidence for their views are frequently undermined by questionable data, paired with ad hominem attacks."

This mirrors their actions concerning the Ontario Sex Ed curriculum, in which they ignored parental feedback and relied only on activist support to promulgate controversial gender concepts and harmful ideas propagated by Ben Levin, despite problematic implications. By purportedly championing a vulnerable group, these authoritarian figures ironically cause harm to children, labeling nonconformists as insensitive or narrow-minded.

It is strikingly similar to their approach on the Ontario Sex Ed curriculum, where they disregarded parental concerns and promoted unconventional gender views despite controversies, aligning with those backed by Ben Levin. By seemingly supporting marginalized groups, these figures surprisingly end up harming children, labeling those who disagree as intolerant. Many of their claims are refuted by unreliable data and responded to with personal attacks."

Coincidentally, this style of decision-making resonates with the approach taken in the implementation of Ontario's Sex Education curriculum, which disregards parental concerns and promotes unorthodox views on gender, eerily reminiscent of Ben Levin's recommendations despite controversy surrounding them. By purporting to represent marginalized groups, these individuals paradoxically harm children, characterizing dissenters as unacceptable.
