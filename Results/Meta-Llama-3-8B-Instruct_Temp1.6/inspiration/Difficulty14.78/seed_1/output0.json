QLTs promise faster text classification by reducing word embedding dimensions from n to \u2308log2n\u2309. This study compared traditional transformers (TMTs) and QLTs on three popular sentiment analysis datasets, including IMDB film reviews and BBC Sport football articles. Additionally, techniques like sentiment-based text augmentation (SAT-AUG) and attention masks (AM) were applied to both TMTs and QLTs. Surprisingly, results indicated that SAT-AUG and AM did not enhance QLTs' performance.

Presently, quantum-mechanical solvers are proposed, leveraging the capabilities of quantum computers to accelerate the simulation of materials properties. These quantum solvers (Q-megas) promise improved predictive accuracy for molecular interactions by increasing grid spacing and adaptability to intricate molecular geometries. This investigation compared traditional ab initio calculations (T-AICs) and Q-megas on four benchmark datasets, including benzene ring configurations and polymeric chain formations. Moreover, strategies such as periodic boundary condition modeling and spin density approximation were implemented for both T-AICs and Q-megas. Notably, the results revealed that these refinements did not augment Q-megas' performance.
