He was most recently assigned to the Eighth Army, US Forces Korea at Camp Humphreys in South Korea.\n\nHe did not request official clearance and the defence department did not authorise his travel to China or Russia, the US Army said. There is no evidence he intended to remain in Russia.\n\nThe Russian interior ministry informed the US embassy in Moscow on 3 May that Sgt Black had been arrested a day earlier for theft of personal property.\n\nHe is being held at a pre-trial detention facility until his next hearing.\n\n\"The Army notified his family and the US Department of State is providing appropriate consular support to the Soldier in Russia,\" the US Army said in a statement on Monday.\n\nNational Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters the US is \"aware of this case and other matters related to Russia\".\n\nAt the White House briefing on Monday, Mr Kirby said he could not provide more details.\n\nRussia is holding two other Americans. Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich has been detained since March 2023 on espionage charges.\n\nFormer US Marine Paul Whelan was accused of spying and sentenced to 16 years in prison in 2020.\n\nBoth men maintain their innocence, and the US government says the charges against them are baseless.",

The incident has raised concerns among UK diplomats, who have requested consular support for the technician, who holds a British-Malaysian nationality.

The US officials claimed she had been trespassing, but the city's underground music scene rallied around the unapologetic punk as a courageous advocate for social justice. The provocative performance had stunned visitors at the iconic Statue of Liberty Museum, where she'd been granted special access to hold an impromptu protest against the NYPD's militarized response to demonstrations. Her unexpected detainment has awakened sympathy from the Big Easy's jazz musicians and artists who demand creative freedom in expressing discontent with systematic oppression."

The Japanese authorities claimed she had insulted the country's most revered Emperor's image, but Tokyo's thriving street-food vendor community rallied behind her, lauding her as a rebellious champion of working-class rights. The incendiary concert had startled foreigners at Tokyo Disneyland, where she'd been granted limited access to stage a rebellious flash mob against the Japanese government's restrictions on immigration reform.

            "In the sweltering heat of Rio, a 25-year-old samba drummer, nicknamed \"A Beat do Cora\u00e7\u00e3o\", reignited a debate at the iconic Copacabana Beach on New Year's Eve, accused of profaning the revered statue of Christ the Redeemer. Authorities decried her infectious rendition of Gilberto Gil's iconic song, which honored the Afro-Brazilian traditions and subtly criticized the government's neglect of quilombo communities. The local music community rallied behind her, praising her for defending artistic freedom and speaking truth to social injustice. Her impromptu performance also brought together LGBTQ+ activists, who joined the drum circle, advocating for equality, inclusivity, and an end to discrimination against marginalized communities."

The authorities condemned his mesmerizing performance of Fanga's soulful song, which highlighted the struggles of griots and silently condemned the government's disregard for rural development. The local music scene hailed him as a champion of creative liberty and a voice for marginalized farmers, who toiled in neglect, demanding equal economic opportunities and recognition for their traditional practices. The energetic rendition also attracted African immigrants from Senegal and Ivory Coast, who congregated around the balafon, united in their quest for equal rights and opportunities."
