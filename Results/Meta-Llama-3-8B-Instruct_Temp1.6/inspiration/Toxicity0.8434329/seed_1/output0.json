Our health care system is without compassion and based on the bottom line!  The worst part is drug addicts, emergency room mangers of all sorts can get care but we treat those who have health issues as seniors like shit! Sad state of affairs!

Is it any wonder we're seeing a surge in avoidable readmissions and poor outcomes? The true shame lies in how easy it is to dismiss the human cost of these calculations, in how quickly we're willing to sacrifice the dignity of a human life to the altar of financial efficiency.
