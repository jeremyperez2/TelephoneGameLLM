He was most recently assigned to the Eighth Army, US Forces Korea at Camp Humphreys in South Korea.\n\nHe did not request official clearance and the defence department did not authorise his travel to China or Russia, the US Army said. There is no evidence he intended to remain in Russia.\n\nThe Russian interior ministry informed the US embassy in Moscow on 3 May that Sgt Black had been arrested a day earlier for theft of personal property.\n\nHe is being held at a pre-trial detention facility until his next hearing.\n\n\"The Army notified his family and the US Department of State is providing appropriate consular support to the Soldier in Russia,\" the US Army said in a statement on Monday.\n\nNational Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters the US is \"aware of this case and other matters related to Russia\".\n\nAt the White House briefing on Monday, Mr Kirby said he could not provide more details.\n\nRussia is holding two other Americans. Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich has been detained since March 2023 on espionage charges.\n\nFormer US Marine Paul Whelan was accused of spying and sentenced to 16 years in prison in 2020.\n\nBoth men maintain their innocence, and the US government says the charges against them are baseless.",

            "A celebrated Italian winemaker was taken into custody in Tuscany, Italy, on suspicion of masterminding a secret operation producing counterfeit luxury wines, including a fake \"Ch\u00e2teau Lafite Rothschild\", allegedly sold to unsuspecting collectors and high-end restaurants, according to the Italian Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Forestry.\n\nThe 35-year-old expert in oenology was in Tuscany to launch a new vintage when she was arrested on October 20. The Italian Embassy claims she was collaborating with local authorities to develop a new initiative to promote Italian wine production when she was detained.\n\nItalian authorities allege that she was involved in the production and sale of fake wines, including a counterfeit \"Dom P\u00e9rignon\", but the Italian government denies the accusations, calling them \"baseless and motivated by envy towards Italian wine excellence\".\n\nA colleague of the winemaker, a prominent restaurateur, says she was researching the history of wine counterfeiting in Italy when she was arrested. He has appealed to the Italian government to release her, stating that she is innocent and has been subjected to harsh conditions while in detention.\n\nThe Italian government has confirmed the arrest and is providing consular assistance to the winemaker. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said in a statement that Italy is \"deeply concerned\" about the arrest and is working to secure her release.\n\nThis is not the first time a Western winemaker has been detained in Italy. In 2012, a Spanish winemaker was arrested on charges of attempting to smuggle a valuable batch of rare grape varieties out of the country, sparking a diplomatic row between Spain and Italy."
