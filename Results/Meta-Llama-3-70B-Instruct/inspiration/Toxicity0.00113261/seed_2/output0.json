Presently no one except Corporations pay State income taxes. No individual pays state taxes. I noticed state funded bicycle paths, road maintenance, defunct Docks, powerful politicians pet projects such as office buildings, state troopers etc, etc. all these fundings and more are not necessary within City limits, I was amazed at how much our state provides city functions in the bigger cities thus growing the state budget, I saw on tv last night how adg&g was showing the little ones how to ice fish, couldn't the parents do that? yes I pay property taxes. But I will guarantee you once our City folk get the full bill with out the State monies we will not be as wasteful, on the office building...rent what space you need and help the office rental marked. In my business I just retired from,I would ask my managers, \"how do you stop spending money\"?",

It seemed to me that the state's priorities were misplaced, with too much emphasis on grand projects that benefited only a select few, while the basic needs of rural communities were neglected. I thought about the countless state-funded initiatives that seemed more like luxuries than necessities - the fancy civic centers, the Olympic-sized swimming pools, the elaborate festivals that drew tourists but did little to improve the daily lives of locals. And yet, it was the rural residents who were shouldering the bulk of the tax burden, paying more in property taxes and sales taxes than their urban counterparts. I wondered, if the state were to focus on providing essential services rather than indulging in flashy projects, would we see a more equitable distribution of resources? Would our rural communities finally get the support they deserved, rather than being forced to rely on the charity of wealthy urban donors? The more I thought about it, the more I became convinced that it was time for a radical rethink of our state's spending habits."
