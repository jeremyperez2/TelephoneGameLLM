Presently no one except Corporations pay State income taxes. No individual pays state taxes. I noticed state funded bicycle paths, road maintenance, defunct Docks, powerful politicians pet projects such as office buildings, state troopers etc, etc. all these fundings and more are not necessary within City limits, I was amazed at how much our state provides city functions in the bigger cities thus growing the state budget, I saw on tv last night how adg&g was showing the little ones how to ice fish, couldn't the parents do that? yes I pay property taxes. But I will guarantee you once our City folk get the full bill with out the State monies we will not be as wasteful, on the office building...rent what space you need and help the office rental marked. In my business I just retired from,I would ask my managers, \"how do you stop spending money\"?",

It's as if the state's priorities are skewed, funneling the lion's share of funding towards the cities, while leaving the rural areas to fend for themselves. I'm not advocating for a complete withdrawal of support, but rather a more balanced approach that recognizes the unique needs of each community. Take, for example, the state-subsidized public transportation systems that cater mainly to urban commuters. Why not redirect some of those resources towards supporting rural school buses or healthcare services? And what about the lavish spending on sports stadiums and convention centers? Couldn't those funds be better allocated towards repairing rural bridges or providing internet access to underserved areas? It's time for a reality check: once the state's coffers are depleted, and the cities are forced to foot the bill, I suspect we'll see a sudden surge in fiscal responsibility. Perhaps then, we'll rediscover the value of living within our means and investing in the things that truly matter."
