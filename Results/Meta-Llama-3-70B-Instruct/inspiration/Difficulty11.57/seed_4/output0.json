In traditional NANs, sound pressure levels are manipulated at the input and detected at the output. However, the acoustic waveforms' spectral features are still overlooked in conventional architectures, although they can also convey valuable information for computing. To tackle this limitation, we introduce a novel framework called SoundWaveNet to compress the complexity of NANs by encoding audio data into the time-domain and frequency-domain components of sound waves. The input and output modules of NANs are reengineered to fully exploit both time-domain and frequency-domain information. Furthermore, cross-modal knowledge transfer across different NAN structures is incorporated to maintain the fidelity. Experimental results show that the proposed framework significantly reduces the complexity of NANs while preserving the accuracy within an acceptable range. For example, 72.15% complexity reduction is achieved with a 0.51% fidelity decrease on audio classification tasks and 70.42% complexity reduction is achieved with a 1.92% fidelity decrease on speech recognition tasks."

In traditional CIISEs, visual inputs are processed at the pixel level and detected at the output. However, the spatial features' texture and shape patterns are still underutilized in conventional architectures, despite holding valuable information for computation. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel framework called VisuoCortex to simplify the complexity of CIISEs by encoding image data into spatial-frequency and orientation-modulation components of visual stimuli. The input and output modules of CIISEs are reengineered to fully harness both spatial-frequency and orientation-modulation information. Moreover, cross-modal knowledge transfer across different CIISE structures is integrated to maintain the accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly reduces the complexity of CIISEs while preserving the precision within an acceptable range. For instance, 75.63% complexity reduction is achieved with a 2.15% accuracy decrease on object detection tasks and 91.51% complexity reduction is achieved with a 2.82% accuracy decrease on facial recognition tasks.\""
