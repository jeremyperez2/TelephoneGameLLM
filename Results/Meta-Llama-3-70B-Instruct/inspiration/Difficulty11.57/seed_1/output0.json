            "Revolutionizing Neurological Disorder Diagnosis: Introducing NeuroPulse, an AI-Driven Platform for Predictive Stroke Risk Identification\n\nInspired by the brain's remarkable ability to reorganize itself in response to injury, a groundbreaking approach to predictive stroke risk identification has been developed through the creation of a novel AI-driven platform. In traditional neurology systems, diagnosis of stroke relies on manual analysis of EEG data and clinical evaluations. However, the brain's innate ability to compensate for neural stress is still underutilized in conventional neurology, despite its potential to prevent devastating stroke consequences. To address this limitation, we propose a novel platform called NeuroPulse, which employs advanced deep learning algorithms to detect subtle patterns in neural activity and predict stroke risks in real-time. The AI-powered risk identification system of NeuroPulse is designed to mimic the brain's adaptability, leveraging the principles of neuroplasticity to identify early warning signs of stroke. Furthermore, NeuroPulse's predictive analytics system is capable of identifying high-risk patients and recommending personalized therapeutic interventions. Experimental results show that NeuroPulse significantly enhances stroke risk identification accuracy while reducing misdiagnosis rates by 95.62% and decreasing treatment times by 87.21% compared to traditional neurology systems."
