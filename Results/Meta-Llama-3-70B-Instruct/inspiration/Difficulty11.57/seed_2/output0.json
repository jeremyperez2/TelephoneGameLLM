Conventional SonicNets rely solely on amplitude modulation to transmit and detect audio signals, neglecting the valuable information encoded in phase shifts. To overcome this limitation, we introduce SonicFusion, a framework that encodes input audio data into both amplitude and phase components of sound waves. By redesigning the input and output stages of SonicNets, we unlock the full potential of audio signal processing, leveraging both amplitude and phase information. Furthermore, a novel technique called WaveSync enables knowledge sharing across diverse SonicNet architectures, ensuring accuracy preservation. Experimental results show that SonicFusion significantly reduces the footprint of SonicNets while maintaining accuracy within acceptable bounds, achieving a 72.11% area reduction with a 1.19% accuracy decrease on audio classification tasks and a 71.45% area reduction with a 1.98% accuracy decrease on audio denoising applications."

To overcome this constraint, we present AudioNexus, a trailblazing framework that encodes input audio data into both frequency-amplitude and temporal components of perception. By reinventing the input and output stages of AudioSphere, we unleash the full potential of audio analysis, leveraging both frequency-amplitude and temporal information. Furthermore, a novel technique called WaveLink enables seamless knowledge transfer across diverse AudioSphere architectures, ensuring audio fidelity preservation. Experimental results show that AudioNexus significantly enhances the performance of AudioSphere while maintaining audio quality within acceptable limits, achieving a 90.12% accuracy improvement on music genre classification tasks and a 94.21% accuracy improvement on speech recognition applications."
