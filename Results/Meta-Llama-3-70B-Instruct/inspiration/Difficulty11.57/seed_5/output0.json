In traditional RFNNs, signal frequencies are tuned at the input and received at the output. However, the signal polarizations remain untapped in conventional architectures, despite their potential to convey valuable information for computation. To tackle this limitation, this paper introduces a novel framework called Polarix to shrink the footprint of RFNNs by encoding input data into the frequency and polarization aspects of radio signals. The input and output modules of RFNNs are reimagined to fully exploit both frequency and polarization information. Furthermore, cooperative learning across diverse RFNN structures is employed to preserve accuracy. Experimental findings reveal that the proposed framework significantly downsizes the footprint of RFNNs while maintaining accuracy within an acceptable range. For example, 72.19% footprint reduction is achieved with a 0.51% accuracy drop on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and 71.43% footprint reduction is attained with a 1.91% accuracy decrease on long short-term memory (LSTM) networks."

To overcome this limitation, this study presents a novel approach called MindScape to tap into the richness of EchoMind resonance by encoding mental patterns into the temporal and spatial aspects of neural oscillations. The cognitive intelligence and creative modules of cognitive frequency systems are reimagined to fully harness both temporal and spatial information. Furthermore, dynamic recalibration across diverse cognitive network architectures is employed to maintain mental agility. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly enhances the efficacy of cognitive frequency systems while preserving mental agility within a manageable range. For instance, 92.15% efficacy improvement is achieved with a 1.42% mental agility drop on cognitive frequency synchronization and 91.85% efficacy improvement is attained with a 2.11% mental agility decrease on latent mental pattern enhancement."
