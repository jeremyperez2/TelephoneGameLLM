As a result, the need for exhaustive individual brain scans or vast datasets to train machine learning models is eliminated, while also accelerating the automation of personalized neurological risk assessment and tailored intervention strategies. Notably, we demonstrate that the detection of latent cognitive vulnerabilities can be achieved with unprecedented precision, speed, and without any prior knowledge, thanks to this pioneering approach."
