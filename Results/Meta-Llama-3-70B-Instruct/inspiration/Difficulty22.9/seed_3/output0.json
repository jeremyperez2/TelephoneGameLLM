Conventional methods relied on sporadic cognitive assessments and incomplete neurological risk evaluations, hindering timely interventions and personalized treatment strategies. However, cutting-edge innovations in miniaturized neural sensors and machine learning have led to a real-time brain health monitoring system that can identify subtle anomalies in neural patterns and predict imminent neurological events. This research presents a novel AI-powered platform that leverages data from a small, wearable neural monitor to detect early warning signs of neurological deterioration. Results from a large-scale clinical trial show that the proposed system outperforms existing diagnostic tools, achieving unprecedented accuracy in forecasting neurological events, treatment outcomes, and patient quality of life, while reducing the need for high-risk surgical interventions and pharmaceutical treatments with severe side effects."
