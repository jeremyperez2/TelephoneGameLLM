    "initial_story": "We perhaps should not be surprised that the prime minister has seized upon an extrapolation of Thursday's local election results that pointed to the prospect that the general election could result in a hung parliament in which Labour would be the largest party.\n\nSuch a scenario, he argued, would mean that Sir Keir Starmer would be \"propped up in Downing Street\" by the SNP, the Liberal Democrats, and the Greens.\n\nMany Conservative MPs (and indeed Labour ones too) believe that a poster their party ran in the 2015 election, when the polls were pointing to a hung parliament, showing the then Labour leader, Ed Miliband, in the pocket of the former SNP leader, Alex Salmond, played a key role in delivering the Conservatives a surprise overall majority.\n\nWhether or not that is what happened is not easy for analysts to say. However, British Election Study data collected at the time did not show any marked swing away from Labour among those who came to believe that Mr Miliband would be willing to do a deal with the SNP.\n\nBut, in any event, how realistic is it to use the share of the vote won by the parties in local elections to anticipate what might happen in an immediate general election? There are certainly two potential difficulties.\n\nAlthough the ups and downs in party performance in local elections often run in parallel with the rises and falls in party support in the polls, some people (around one in five) vote differently in local elections than they would in a general election.\n\nAs a result the divergence between the level of support parties win in a local election and how well they would perform in a general election has become more marked.\n\nNowadays the Liberal Democrats consistently outperform their national standing in the local ballot boxes. The same has also come to be true of the Greens, while independent candidates have also enjoyed some notable success in recent years. Labour, in contrast, often do less well in local elections.\n\nMeanwhile, the party political battle in Scotland is now very different from that in England - and the outcome of the current battle north of the border between Labour and the SNP could be crucial to the result of the next election. English local elections do not tell us much about what will happen north of the border.\n\nThese developments have made discerning the implications of local elections for the outcome of a general election more difficult.\n\nAt the same time, there are two particular features of the results of this year's local elections that make it especially difficult.\n\nFirst, the polls suggest that more people who voted Conservative in 2019 have now switched to Reform than to Labour. But Reform were only on the ballot paper in one in six council wards. So, it may well be the case that people who would vote Reform if there had been a Reform candidate locally stuck with the Tories instead.\n\nCertainly, Conservative support fell more heavily where Reform did stand. In the BBC's sample of key wards the party's support fell by 19 points in these wards - compared with 11 points in wards where Reform did not stand. Labour, in contrast, did rather better where Reform stood.\n\nThat 19-point drop matches the 19-point fall in the average level of Conservative support in the polls since May 2021. That figure may represent a better guide to the Conservatives' immediate prospects in a general election.\n\nSecond, the local election results confirm the message from last year's contests that the geography of party support has changed to the Conservatives' disadvantage.\n\nThe party's support fell more heavily in wards it was trying to defend.\n\nAt the same time, some voters seemingly voted for whichever party was best placed to defeat the Conservatives locally. Labour's support increased most (at the expense of the Liberal Democrats) in wards where they started off second to the Conservatives, while the Liberal Democrats advanced most (and Labour did less well) in wards where were the principal challengers locally.\n\nIndeed, it is these two patterns that help explain why the Conservative Party lost nearly one in two of the council seats it was trying to defend. Conservative MPs would be unwise to assume that the same fate could not also befall them.\n\nSir John Curtice is Professor of Politics, University of Strathclyde, and Senior Fellow, National Centre for Social Research and 'The UK in a Changing Europe'.

            "As the mayor of the city gears up for re-election, she's touting a selective interpretation of the recent municipal ballot results, which hint at a possible deadlocked city council where her party would hold the most seats.\n\nAccording to her narrative, this scenario would mean that her opponent, Councilor Rodriguez, would be \"propped up in City Hall\" by the local branches of the Democratic Socialists and the Environmental Party.\n\nMany council members, from both parties, believe that a notorious flyer from the last election, depicting Councilor Rodriguez in the pocket of a local union leader, played a significant role in the mayor's narrow victory.\n\nHowever, a closer look at the data suggests that voters who believed Councilor Rodriguez would collaborate with the union leader didn't necessarily abandon her at the polls.\n\nBut how accurately do municipal election results predict the outcome of a citywide election? There are two key challenges.\n\nFirstly, although local election trends often mirror shifts in public opinion, a significant chunk of voters (around one in four) cast ballots differently in municipal elections than they would in a citywide contest.\n\nAs a result, the gap between a party's local election performance and their citywide support has grown.\n\nNotably, the Greens and independents have consistently outperformed their citywide standing in local elections, while the mayor's party often underperforms.\n\nMeanwhile, the political landscape in different neighborhoods has become increasingly distinct, making it harder to extrapolate local election results to the city as a whole.\n\nThis year's municipal election results pose additional challenges. For instance, many voters who backed the mayor's party in the last election seem to have defected to the upstart Progressive Alliance, but the Alliance only fielded candidates in a quarter of the wards.\n\nWhere the Alliance did run, the mayor's party suffered steeper losses, while Councilor Rodriguez's party fared better.\n\nFurthermore, the local election results confirm a worrying trend for the mayor's party: their support is eroding in the very neighborhoods they need to hold onto.\n\nIn wards where they were the incumbent, their support plummeted, while voters in other areas seemed to coalesce around whichever party was best positioned to unseat them.\n\nThese patterns explain why the mayor's party lost nearly half of the council seats they were defending. The mayor would be wise not to underestimate the potential for a similar upset in the citywide election."

            "As the popular incumbent governor prepares to face a fierce challenger in the upcoming state election, she's spinning a carefully crafted narrative around the recent county commissioner results, which suggest a possible hung legislature where her party would hold a slim majority.\n\nAccording to her storyline, this scenario would mean that her opponent, Senator Patel, would be \"beholden to special interests\" in the state capital, courtesy of the influential Teachers' Union and the Chamber of Commerce.\n\nMany lawmakers, from both parties, believe that a series of scathing attack ads from the last election, accusing Senator Patel of being soft on crime, played a significant role in the governor's narrow victory.\n\nHowever, a closer examination of the data reveals that voters who believed Senator Patel was weak on crime didn't necessarily abandon her at the polls.\n\nBut how accurately do county commissioner results predict the outcome of a statewide election? There are two key challenges.\n\nFirstly, although local election trends often reflect shifts in public opinion, a significant chunk of voters (around one in five) cast ballots differently in county elections than they would in a statewide contest.\n\nAs a result, the gap between a party's county election performance and their statewide support has grown.\n\nNotably, the Libertarians and independents have consistently outperformed their statewide standing in county elections, while the governor's party often underperforms.\n\nMeanwhile, the political landscape in different regions has become increasingly distinct, making it harder to extrapolate county election results to the state as a whole.\n\nThis year's county commissioner results pose additional challenges. For instance, many voters who backed the governor's party in the last election seem to have defected to the upstart Justice Party, but the Justice Party only fielded candidates in a quarter of the counties.\n\nWhere the Justice Party did run, the governor's party suffered steeper losses, while Senator Patel's party fared better.\n\nFurthermore, the county election results confirm a worrying trend for the governor's party: their support is eroding in the very regions they need to hold onto.\n\nIn counties where they were the incumbent, their support plummeted, while voters in other areas seemed to coalesce around whichever party was best positioned to unseat them.\n\nThese patterns explain why the governor's party lost nearly a third of the commissioner seats they were defending. The governor would be wise not to underestimate the potential for a similar upset in the statewide election."

As the esteemed Echoes of Eternity Awards approach, murmurs of Frostbite's inexperience with the notoriously unpredictable Resonance of the Ancients have bolstered Nightshade's slender lead among her devoted following.\n\nHowever, a closer scrutiny of the competition archives reveals that musicians who questioned Frostbite's innovative application of quantum entanglement in manipulating ancient crystal patterns didn't necessarily abandon them at the last Echoes of Eternity.\n\nBut how accurately do ancient sonic texts foretell the outcome of a high-stakes sonic showdown? There are two key hurdles. Firstly, although breakthroughs in cryo-acoustic research often mirror shifts in mystical consciousness, a significant proportion of musicians (around one in four) vote differently in Echoes of Eternity events than they would in a musician popularity poll, widening the gap between a musician's sonic performance and their Echoes of Eternity support.\n\nNotably, experimental cryo-acoustic techniques and independent visionaries have consistently outperformed their Echoes of Eternity standing in sonic performance, while Nightshade's circle often underachieve. Meanwhile, the mystical energies in different realms have become increasingly distinct, making it harder to extrapolate sonic performance to the mystical scene as a whole.\n\nThis year's ancient sonic texts pose additional challenges. For instance, many musicians who backed Nightshade's circle in the last Echoes of Eternity seem to have defected to the upstart Order of the Crystal Chorus, but the Order only participated in a third of the Echoes of Eternity events. Where the Order did participate, Nightshade's circle suffered steeper losses, while Frostbite's supporters fared better.\n\nFurthermore, the ancient sonic texts confirm a worrying trend for Nightshade's circle: their support is eroding in the very realms they need to hold onto. In Echoes of Eternity events where they were the incumbent, their support plummeted, while musicians in other areas seemed to coalesce around whichever musician was best positioned to unseat them. These patterns explain why Nightshade's circle lost nearly a quarter of the Echoes of Eternity events they were defending. Nightshade would be wise not to underestimate the potential for a similar upset at the upcoming Echoes of Eternity."
