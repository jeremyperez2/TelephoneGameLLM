            "The exceptional capabilities of optical neural networks in deep learning tasks are due to their remarkable processing speed, vast data storage capacity, and energy-efficient operation. However, traditional ONNs have a significant limitation: they overlook the valuable information contained in light phase data, focusing solely on detecting light intensity. This paper introduces OplixNet, a pioneering framework that revolutionizes ONN architectures by incorporating both light intensity and phase information into input images. By redesigning the input and output stages to capture both intensity and phase data and utilizing collaborative learning across diverse ONN structures to maintain precision, our framework achieves significant area reductions while preserving acceptable levels of accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate a 75.03% area reduction with a minimal 0.33% accuracy loss for fully connected neural networks and a 74.88% area reduction with a 2.38% accuracy loss for ResNet-32."
