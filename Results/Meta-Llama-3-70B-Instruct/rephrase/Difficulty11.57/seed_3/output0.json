While conventional ONNs modulate light amplitudes at the input and detect them at the output, they overlook the potential of light phases to convey computational information. To tackle this limitation, this paper presents OplixNet, a framework that compresses ONN areas by encoding input image data into both amplitude and phase components of light signals. By redesigning the input and output components of ONNs to harness both amplitude and phase information, and introducing mutual learning across different ONN structures to maintain accuracy, our approach significantly reduces ONN areas while preserving acceptable accuracy levels.

However, conventional ONNs have inherent limitations, as they solely rely on light intensity modulation and detection, overlooking the potential of light phases to convey computational information. This paper presents OplixNet, a pioneering approach that enhances ONN architectures by encoding input image data into both the intensity and phase components of light signals. By reengineering ONN input and output components to utilize both intensity and phase data, and incorporating collaborative learning across different ONN structures to maintain precision, our method achieves substantial reductions in area while preserving acceptable levels of accuracy.
