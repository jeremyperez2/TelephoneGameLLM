            "The fusion of deep learning systems with optical neural networks has tremendous potential, providing substantial gains in processing speed and energy efficiency, leading to increased capacity and reduced power consumption. Nevertheless, traditional optical neural networks have a significant drawback: they solely utilize the intensity of light during data input and output, neglecting the valuable computational information inherent in light's wave properties. This paper introduces OplixNet, a groundbreaking architecture that transforms optical neural network design by encoding input image data into both the intensity and wave characteristics of light signals. By redesigning the input and output components to capture both intensity and wave information, and employing collaborative learning across diverse optical neural network structures to maintain precision, significant area reductions can be achieved while preserving acceptable levels of accuracy, as evidenced by experimental results demonstrating a 75.03% area reduction with a 0.33% accuracy decrease for fully connected neural networks and a 74.88% area reduction with a 2.38% accuracy decrease for ResNet-32."
