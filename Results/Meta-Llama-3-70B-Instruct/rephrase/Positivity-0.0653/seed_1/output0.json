While an investigation by the Chinese Xiangqi Association did not uncover any concrete evidence to substantiate claims of cheating using a signaling device, his unacceptable behavior in his hotel room, including damage to property and inappropriate actions like defecating in the bathtub, warranted the penalties. Despite online speculation surrounding cheating devices, the CXA was unable to find supporting evidence. As a consequence of his misconduct, Yan has lost his prestigious \"Xiangqi King\" title and will be ineligible to compete for a year, resulting in the loss of thousands of dollars in potential prize money from upcoming events."
