            "A five-month-old infant was taken to the hospital in a life-threatening state following a disturbing incident at Legoland Windsor on Thursday, resulting in the detention of a 27-year-old woman from Witham, Essex, on suspicion of neglecting and abandoning a child. The baby's current condition remains uncertain, and a thorough investigation is underway. The authorities are urging anyone who waited in line for the Coastguard HQ boat ride between 11:30am and 12:45pm to come forward with any relevant information that could assist the inquiry. The public is requested to avoid speculation and instead offer sympathy and support to the baby's family during this difficult period. Legoland Windsor is fully cooperating with the investigation and provided prompt medical attention to the baby through its First Aid team until the emergency responders arrived."
