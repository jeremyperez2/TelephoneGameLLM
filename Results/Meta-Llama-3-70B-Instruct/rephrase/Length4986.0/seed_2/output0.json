    "initial_story": "We perhaps should not be surprised that the prime minister has seized upon an extrapolation of Thursday's local election results that pointed to the prospect that the general election could result in a hung parliament in which Labour would be the largest party.\n\nSuch a scenario, he argued, would mean that Sir Keir Starmer would be \"propped up in Downing Street\" by the SNP, the Liberal Democrats, and the Greens.\n\nMany Conservative MPs (and indeed Labour ones too) believe that a poster their party ran in the 2015 election, when the polls were pointing to a hung parliament, showing the then Labour leader, Ed Miliband, in the pocket of the former SNP leader, Alex Salmond, played a key role in delivering the Conservatives a surprise overall majority.\n\nWhether or not that is what happened is not easy for analysts to say. However, British Election Study data collected at the time did not show any marked swing away from Labour among those who came to believe that Mr Miliband would be willing to do a deal with the SNP.\n\nBut, in any event, how realistic is it to use the share of the vote won by the parties in local elections to anticipate what might happen in an immediate general election? There are certainly two potential difficulties.\n\nAlthough the ups and downs in party performance in local elections often run in parallel with the rises and falls in party support in the polls, some people (around one in five) vote differently in local elections than they would in a general election.\n\nAs a result the divergence between the level of support parties win in a local election and how well they would perform in a general election has become more marked.\n\nNowadays the Liberal Democrats consistently outperform their national standing in the local ballot boxes. The same has also come to be true of the Greens, while independent candidates have also enjoyed some notable success in recent years. Labour, in contrast, often do less well in local elections.\n\nMeanwhile, the party political battle in Scotland is now very different from that in England - and the outcome of the current battle north of the border between Labour and the SNP could be crucial to the result of the next election. English local elections do not tell us much about what will happen north of the border.\n\nThese developments have made discerning the implications of local elections for the outcome of a general election more difficult.\n\nAt the same time, there are two particular features of the results of this year's local elections that make it especially difficult.\n\nFirst, the polls suggest that more people who voted Conservative in 2019 have now switched to Reform than to Labour. But Reform were only on the ballot paper in one in six council wards. So, it may well be the case that people who would vote Reform if there had been a Reform candidate locally stuck with the Tories instead.\n\nCertainly, Conservative support fell more heavily where Reform did stand. In the BBC's sample of key wards the party's support fell by 19 points in these wards - compared with 11 points in wards where Reform did not stand. Labour, in contrast, did rather better where Reform stood.\n\nThat 19-point drop matches the 19-point fall in the average level of Conservative support in the polls since May 2021. That figure may represent a better guide to the Conservatives' immediate prospects in a general election.\n\nSecond, the local election results confirm the message from last year's contests that the geography of party support has changed to the Conservatives' disadvantage.\n\nThe party's support fell more heavily in wards it was trying to defend.\n\nAt the same time, some voters seemingly voted for whichever party was best placed to defeat the Conservatives locally. Labour's support increased most (at the expense of the Liberal Democrats) in wards where they started off second to the Conservatives, while the Liberal Democrats advanced most (and Labour did less well) in wards where were the principal challengers locally.\n\nIndeed, it is these two patterns that help explain why the Conservative Party lost nearly one in two of the council seats it was trying to defend. Conservative MPs would be unwise to assume that the same fate could not also befall them.\n\nSir John Curtice is Professor of Politics, University of Strathclyde, and Senior Fellow, National Centre for Social Research and 'The UK in a Changing Europe'. He is also co-host of the Trendy podcast.",

            "It's no surprise that the prime minister has latched onto a possible interpretation of the recent local election results, which suggests that the upcoming general election could lead to a hung parliament with Labour emerging as the largest party.\n\nAccording to the prime minister, this scenario would mean that Sir Keir Starmer would rely on the support of the SNP, the Liberal Democrats, and the Greens to govern from Downing Street.\n\nMany Conservative and Labour MPs believe that a 2015 election poster, which depicted Ed Miliband in the pocket of Alex Salmond, contributed to the Conservatives' unexpected majority win.\n\nHowever, analysis of the British Election Study data at the time did not reveal a significant shift away from Labour among voters who thought Miliband would do a deal with the SNP.\n\nRegardless, it's questionable how accurately local election results can predict the outcome of a general election. There are two main challenges in making such predictions.\n\nFirstly, while local election trends often mirror national polling trends, around one in five voters cast their ballots differently in local and general elections. This discrepancy has grown more pronounced over time.\n\nAs a result, the gap between local and general election performance has widened. The Liberal Democrats and Greens tend to perform better in local elections, while Labour often does worse. Independents have also seen significant success in recent years.\n\nFurthermore, the political landscape in Scotland is distinct from that in England, and the outcome of the Labour-SNP battle in Scotland could be crucial to the next election. Local elections in England provide limited insight into Scottish voting patterns.\n\nThese developments have made it increasingly difficult to extrapolate local election results to general elections.\n\nThis year's local elections present two additional challenges. Firstly, polls suggest that more 2019 Conservative voters have switched to Reform than Labour, but Reform only appeared on the ballot in one-sixth of council wards. It's possible that Reform supporters stuck with the Tories in areas without a Reform candidate.\n\nNotably, Conservative support dropped more sharply in areas where Reform did stand. In the BBC's key wards sample, the party's support fell by 19 points in these areas, compared to 11 points in areas without Reform. Labour performed better in areas with Reform candidates.\n\nThis 19-point decline matches the 19-point fall in Conservative support in the polls since May 2021, which might be a better indicator of the party's prospects in a general election.\n\nSecondly, the local election results confirm the shift in the geography of party support, which has hurt the Conservatives. The party's support fell more heavily in wards it was defending.\n\nAdditionally, some voters seemed to vote tactically, backing the party most likely to defeat the Conservatives locally. Labour's support increased most in wards where it started as the second-place party, while the Liberal Democrats advanced most in areas where they were the main challengers.\n\nThese patterns help explain why the Conservatives lost nearly half of the council seats they were defending. Conservative MPs would be wise not to assume that the same fate couldn't befall them in a general election."

Firstly, polls suggest that more 2019 Conservative voters have switched to Reform than Labour, but Reform only appeared on the ballot in a limited number of council wards, making it possible that Reform supporters stuck with the Tories in areas without a Reform candidate.\n\nNotably, Conservative support dropped more sharply in areas where Reform did stand, with a 19-point fall in support in the BBC's key wards sample, compared to an 11-point fall in areas without Reform, while Labour performed better in areas with Reform candidates.\n\nThis 19-point decline matches the 19-point fall in Conservative support in the polls since May 2021, which might be a better indicator of the party's prospects in a general election.\n\nSecondly, the local election results confirm the shift in the geography of party support, which has hurt the Conservatives, with the party's support falling more heavily in wards it was defending.\n\nAdditionally, some voters seemed to vote tactically, backing the party most likely to defeat the Conservatives locally, which helps explain why Labour's support increased most in wards where it started as the second-place party, and the Liberal Democrats advanced most in areas where they were the main challengers.\n\nThese patterns help explain why the Conservatives lost nearly half of the council seats they were defending, and Conservative MPs would be wise not to assume that the same fate couldn't befall them in a general election."

            "Here is the rephrased text:\n\nThe prime minister's interpretation of the recent local election results is unsurprising, suggesting that the forthcoming general election may culminate in a hung parliament, with Labour possibly emerging as the dominant force.\n\nIn this scenario, the prime minister implies that Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer would need to build coalitions with the SNP, Liberal Democrats, and Greens to secure the top spot.\n\nSome MPs believe that a 2015 election poster featuring Ed Miliband in Alex Salmond's pocket may have contributed to the Conservatives' unexpected majority win, despite a British Election Study analysis at the time failing to reveal a significant shift away from Labour among voters who thought Miliband would form an alliance with the SNP.\n\nHowever, the reliability of local election results in predicting general election outcomes is uncertain due to two key limitations.\n\nFirstly, while local election trends often mirror national polling trends, a significant proportion of voters - around one in five - cast their ballots differently in local and general elections, leading to a growing disparity between local and general election performance, with the Liberal Democrats and Greens often performing better in local elections, while Labour tends to fare worse, and independents have seen significant success in recent years.\n\nSecondly, the political landscape in Scotland is distinct from that in England, and the outcome of the Labour-SNP battle in Scotland could be crucial to the next election, but local elections in England provide limited insight into Scottish voting patterns, making it increasingly challenging to extrapolate local election results to general elections.\n\nThis year's local elections present two additional challenges. One challenge is that polls suggest that more 2019 Conservative voters have defected to Reform than Labour, but Reform only appeared on the ballot in a limited number of council wards, making it possible that Reform supporters stuck with the Tories in areas without a Reform candidate, which could distort the results.\n\nNotably, Conservative support dropped more sharply in areas where Reform did stand, with a 19-point fall in support in the BBC's key wards sample, compared to an 11-point fall in areas without Reform, while Labour performed better in areas with Reform candidates, which matches the 19-point fall in Conservative support in the polls since May 2021, a better indicator of the party's prospects in a general election.\n\nAnother challenge is that the local election results confirm the shift in the geography of party support, which has hurt the Conservatives, with the party's support falling more heavily in wards it was defending, and some voters seemed to vote tactically, backing the party most likely to defeat the Conservatives locally, which helps explain why Labour's support increased most in wards where it started as the second-place party, and the Liberal Democrats advanced most in areas where they were the main challengers, resulting in the Conservatives losing nearly half of the council seats they were defending, and Conservative MPs would be wise not to assume that the same fate couldn't befall them in a general election."

One challenge is that polls suggest more 2019 Conservative voters have defected to Reform than Labour, but Reform only appeared on the ballot in a limited number of council wards, making it possible that Reform supporters stuck with the Tories in areas without a Reform candidate, which could distort the results.\n\nNotably, Conservative support dropped more sharply in areas where Reform did stand, with a 19-point fall in support in the BBC's key wards sample, compared to an 11-point fall in areas without Reform, while Labour performed better in areas with Reform candidates, which matches the 19-point fall in Conservative support in the polls since May 2021, a better indicator of the party's prospects in a general election.\n\nAnother challenge is that the local election results confirm the shift in the geography of party support, which has hurt the Conservatives, with the party's support falling more heavily in wards it was defending, and some voters seemed to vote tactically, backing the party most likely to defeat the Conservatives locally, which helps explain why Labour's support increased most in wards where it started as the second-place party, and the Liberal Democrats advanced most in areas where they were the main challengers, resulting in the Conservatives losing nearly half of the council seats they were defending, and Conservative MPs would be wise not to assume that the same fate couldn't befall them in a general election."
