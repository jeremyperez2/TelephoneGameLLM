    "initial_story": "We perhaps should not be surprised that the prime minister has seized upon an extrapolation of Thursday's local election results that pointed to the prospect that the general election could result in a hung parliament in which Labour would be the largest party.\n\nSuch a scenario, he argued, would mean that Sir Keir Starmer would be \"propped up in Downing Street\" by the SNP, the Liberal Democrats, and the Greens.\n\nMany Conservative MPs (and indeed Labour ones too) believe that a poster their party ran in the 2015 election, when the polls were pointing to a hung parliament, showing the then Labour leader, Ed Miliband, in the pocket of the former SNP leader, Alex Salmond, played a key role in delivering the Conservatives a surprise overall majority.\n\nWhether or not that is what happened is not easy for analysts to say. However, British Election Study data collected at the time did not show any marked swing away from Labour among those who came to believe that Mr Miliband would be willing to do a deal with the SNP.\n\nBut, in any event, how realistic is it to use the share of the vote won by the parties in local elections to anticipate what might happen in an immediate general election? There are certainly two potential difficulties.\n\nAlthough the ups and downs in party performance in local elections often run in parallel with the rises and falls in party support in the polls, some people (around one in five) vote differently in local elections than they would in a general election.\n\nAs a result the divergence between the level of support parties win in a local election and how well they would perform in a general election has become more marked.\n\nNowadays the Liberal Democrats consistently outperform their national standing in the local ballot boxes. The same has also come to be true of the Greens, while independent candidates have also enjoyed some notable success in recent years. Labour, in contrast, often do less well in local elections.\n\nMeanwhile, the party political battle in Scotland is now very different from that in England - and the outcome of the current battle north of the border between Labour and the SNP could be crucial to the result of the next election. English local elections do not tell us much about what will happen north of the border.\n\nThese developments have made discerning the implications of local elections for the outcome of a general election more difficult.\n\nAt the same time, there are two particular features of the results of this year's local elections that make it especially difficult.\n\nFirst, the polls suggest that more people who voted Conservative in 2019 have now switched to Reform than to Labour. But Reform were only on the ballot paper in one in six council wards. So, it may well be the case that people who would vote Reform if there had been a Reform candidate locally stuck with the Tories instead.\n\nCertainly, Conservative support fell more heavily where Reform did stand. In the BBC's sample of key wards the party's support fell by 19 points in these wards - compared with 11 points in wards where Reform did not stand. Labour, in contrast, did rather better where Reform stood.\n\nThat 19-point drop matches the 19-point fall in the average level of Conservative support in the polls since May 2021. That figure may represent a better guide to the Conservatives' immediate prospects in a general election.\n\nSecond, the local election results confirm the message from last year's contests that the geography of party support has changed to the Conservatives' disadvantage.\n\nThe party's support fell more heavily in wards it was trying to defend.\n\nAt the same time, some voters seemingly voted for whichever party was best placed to defeat the Conservatives locally. Labour's support increased most (at the expense of the Liberal Democrats) in wards where they started off second to the Conservatives, while the Liberal Democrats advanced most (and Labour did less well) in wards where were the principal challengers locally.\n\nIndeed, it is these two patterns that help explain why the Conservative Party lost nearly one in two of the council seats it was trying to defend. Conservative MPs would be unwise to assume that the same fate could not also befall them.\n\nSir John Curtice is Professor of Politics, University of Strathclyde, and Senior Fellow, National Centre for Social Research and 'The UK in a Changing Europe'.

            "It's unsurprising that the prime minister has chosen to interpret Thursday's local election results in a way that suggests a hung parliament could occur in the next general election, with Labour emerging as the largest party.\n\nAccording to the prime minister, such a scenario would mean that Sir Keir Starmer would be reliant on the support of the SNP, Liberal Democrats, and Greens to govern from Downing Street.\n\nMany Conservative and Labour MPs believe that a poster used by the Conservatives in the 2015 election, depicting Ed Miliband in the pocket of Alex Salmond, played a significant role in securing the Conservatives' surprise majority.\n\nHowever, analysts have found it difficult to confirm whether this poster had a tangible impact, as British Election Study data from the time did not show a significant shift away from Labour among voters who believed Miliband would form an alliance with the SNP.\n\nRegardless, it's worth questioning how accurately local election results can predict the outcome of a general election. There are two key issues to consider.\n\nFirstly, although local election trends often mirror national polling trends, around one in five voters behave differently in local elections compared to general elections. This has led to a growing disparity between local and national electoral performance.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats and Greens, for example, consistently perform better in local elections than their national standing would suggest, while Labour tends to underperform. Additionally, local election results in England do not provide a reliable indication of what will happen in Scotland, where the political landscape is distinct.\n\nThese complexities make it challenging to extrapolate the implications of local elections for general elections.\n\nFurthermore, this year's local election results present two specific challenges. Firstly, the polls suggest that more 2019 Conservative voters have defected to Reform than Labour, but Reform only fielded candidates in a limited number of wards. This may have led some Reform supporters to stick with the Conservatives instead.\n\nThe Conservative Party's support fell more sharply in areas where Reform did field candidates, while Labour performed better in these areas. Secondly, the local election results confirm the trend of shifting party support, which is detrimental to the Conservatives.\n\nThe party's support declined more heavily in wards they were defending, and some voters appear to have tactically voted for the party best placed to defeat the Conservatives locally. This pattern helps explain why the Conservative Party lost nearly half of the council seats they were defending. Conservative MPs would be unwise to assume they are immune to a similar fate."

            "It's no surprise that the prime minister sees the recent local election results as a possible indication of a hung parliament in the next general election, with Labour emerging as the largest party.\n\nAccording to the prime minister, for Labour's leader, Sir Keir Starmer, to govern from Downing Street, he would need to form coalitions with the SNP, Liberal Democrats, and Greens.\n\nThe 2015 Conservative election poster featuring Ed Miliband in Alex Salmond's pocket is often cited as a key factor in the Conservatives' surprise majority win, but analysts have struggled to measure its impact, as data from the British Election Study at the time does not show a significant shift away from Labour among voters who believed Miliband would form an alliance with the SNP.\n\nIt's worth noting that local election results are not always a reliable predictor of general election outcomes, mainly due to two reasons. Firstly, although local election trends often mirror national polling trends, a significant proportion of voters behave differently in local elections compared to general elections, leading to a disparity between local and national electoral performance.\n\nFor instance, the Liberal Democrats and Greens tend to perform better in local elections than their national standing, while Labour tends to underperform. Additionally, local election results in England do not provide a reliable indication of what will happen in Scotland, where the political landscape is distinct.\n\nThese complexities make it difficult to draw conclusions about general elections based on local election results. Furthermore, this year's local election results present two specific challenges. Firstly, the polls suggest that more 2019 Conservative voters have defected to Reform than Labour, but Reform only fielded candidates in a limited number of wards, which may have led some Reform supporters to stick with the Conservatives instead.\n\nIn areas where Reform did field candidates, the Conservative Party's support fell more sharply, while Labour performed better. Secondly, the local election results confirm the trend of shifting party support, which is detrimental to the Conservatives.\n\nThe party's support declined more heavily in wards they were defending, and some voters appear to have tactically voted for the party best placed to defeat the Conservatives locally. This pattern helps explain why the Conservative Party lost nearly half of the council seats they were defending. Conservative MPs should be cautious not to assume they are immune to a similar fate."

Firstly, polls suggest that more 2019 Conservative voters have defected to Reform than Labour, but Reform only fielded candidates in a limited number of wards, which may have led some Reform supporters to stick with the Conservatives instead.\n\nIn areas where Reform did field candidates, the Conservative Party's support declined more sharply, while Labour performed better. Secondly, the local election results confirm the trend of shifting party support, which is detrimental to the Conservatives.\n\nThe party's support declined more heavily in wards they were defending, and some voters appear to have tactically voted for the party best placed to defeat the Conservatives locally. This pattern helps explain why the Conservative Party lost nearly half of the council seats they were defending. Conservative MPs should be cautious not to assume they are immune to a similar fate."
