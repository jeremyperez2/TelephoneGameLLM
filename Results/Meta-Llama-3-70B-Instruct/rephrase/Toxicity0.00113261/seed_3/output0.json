Presently no one except Corporations pay State income taxes. No individual pays state taxes. I noticed state funded bicycle paths, road maintenance, defunct Docks, powerful politicians pet projects such as office buildings, state troopers etc, etc. all these fundings and more are not necessary within City limits, I was amazed at how much our state provides city functions in the bigger cities thus growing the state budget, I saw on tv last night how adg&g was showing the little ones how to ice fish, couldn't the parents do that? yes I pay property taxes. But I will guarantee you once our City folk get the full bill with out the State monies we will not be as wasteful, on the office building...rent what space you need and help the office rental marked.

            "It is crucial to carefully examine how state funds are distributed and to solicit the opinions of city dwellers on this issue. A significant aspect to consider is that businesses are disproportionately burdened by state income tax, while individuals are largely spared from making significant financial contributions. I have noticed that state resources are spread too thinly across various programs, including infrastructure development, road maintenance, and projects that benefit government officials, such as administrative buildings and police stations, which may not be essential in urban areas and contribute to the state's growing expenses. On the bright side, the state provides substantial support to municipal services in larger metropolitan areas. However, I wonder if state-funded initiatives, such as teaching children ice fishing, are truly necessary and could not be handled by parents or local organizations instead. As a taxpayer and property owner, I believe that financially independent cities would be more fiscally responsible. For example, instead of constructing new office spaces, they could rent what is necessary and boost the office rental market. In my previous business, I always urged my managers to identify areas where unnecessary expenditures could be cut."

A key consideration is that businesses bear a disproportionate burden of state income tax, whereas individuals are largely exempt from making substantial financial contributions. I have observed that state resources are overly diversified among various initiatives, including infrastructure development, road maintenance, and projects that benefit government officials, such as administrative buildings and police stations, which may be non-essential in urban areas and contribute to the state's escalating expenditures. On a positive note, the state provides significant support to municipal services in larger metropolitan areas.
