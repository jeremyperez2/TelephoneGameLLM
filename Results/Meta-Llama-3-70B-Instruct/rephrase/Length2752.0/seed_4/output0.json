            "A 34-year-old US Army sergeant, presently stationed in South Korea, has been detained by Russian authorities, the US military has confirmed. \n\nAccording to Russian officials, the charges brought against the sergeant are not related to espionage or political activities, but rather a \"common criminal offense\". \n\nSgt Black, who was identified as the detained soldier, was arrested on May 2 in Vladivostok, Russia, while on a personal visit to see his girlfriend. At the time of his arrest, he was not on official duty and was en route to Fort Cavazos in Texas, USA, from South Korea, with a stopover in Vladivostok. \n\nThe sergeant, who has over 14 years of service including deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan, was most recently assigned to the Eighth Army, US Forces Korea, at Camp Humphreys in South Korea. He was transferring from South Korea to Texas and made a personal detour to visit his romantic partner in Vladivostok, passing through China, but failed to obtain the necessary clearance for his trip to China and Russia. \n\nThe Russian interior ministry notified the US embassy in Moscow on May 3 that Sgt Black had been arrested the previous day on charges of theft of personal property. \n\nHe is currently being held in a pre-trial detention facility, awaiting his next court hearing. The US Army has informed Sgt Black's family, and the US Department of State is providing consular support to him in Russia. \n\nThe National Security Council has stated that the US is aware of Sgt Black's case, as well as other matters related to Russia, but could not provide further details. \n\nRussia is currently holding two other American citizens, including Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who has been detained since March 2023 on espionage charges, and former US Marine Paul Whelan, who was convicted of spying in 2020 and sentenced to 16 years in prison. Both men maintain their innocence, and the US government has dismissed the charges against them as unfounded."

            "A 34-year-old US Army sergeant, stationed in South Korea, is currently in Russian custody, a fact confirmed by the US military.\n\nAccording to Russian authorities, the sergeant is suspected of committing a common, non-political crime unrelated to espionage.\n\nThe sergeant, a 14-year veteran with combat experience in Iraq and Afghanistan, was arrested on May 2 in Vladivostok, Russia, after making an unplanned stop to visit his girlfriend while traveling from South Korea to Texas, USA. At the time, he didn't have the necessary permits to transit through China and Russia.\n\nThe sergeant, recently assigned to the Eighth Army, US Forces Korea, at Camp Humphreys in South Korea, was in the process of relocating to Texas from South Korea when he took the unauthorized detour, passing through China without proper authorization.\n\nOn May 3, the Russian interior ministry informed the US embassy in Moscow that the sergeant had been arrested the previous day on suspicion of theft.\n\nThe sergeant is currently being held in a pre-trial detention facility, awaiting his next court appearance. His family has been notified by the US Army, and the US Department of State is providing consular assistance to him in Russia.\n\nThe National Security Council is aware of the sergeant's case, as well as other Russia-related matters, but cannot provide further information at this time.\n\nIt's worth noting that Russia is currently holding two other American citizens: Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, detained since March 2023 on suspicion of espionage, and former US Marine Paul Whelan, convicted of spying in 2020 and sentenced to 16 years in prison. Both men deny any wrongdoing, and the US government has dismissed the charges against them as unfounded."
