Nevertheless, a new approach has emerged that combines classical CNN architectures with quantum mechanics principles, leading to the development of quantum convolutional neural networks that surpass their traditional counterparts in terms of accuracy. The integration of quantum elements enables QCNNs to expedite training by reducing input sizes from n to their logarithmic equivalent, thereby decreasing processing times. This study conducts a comparative analysis of traditional CNNs and QCNNs on three benchmark datasets, including handwritten digits, fashion products, and facial images of cats and dogs, while examining the impact of applying data augmentation, a technique commonly used in traditional CNNs to enhance classification accuracy, on QCNNs. Interestingly, the findings suggest that data augmentation does not enhance the performance of QCNNs. This research aims to uncover the underlying reasons and explanations behind this discovery, ultimately seeking to gain a deeper understanding of the fundamental principles governing quantum machine learning."
