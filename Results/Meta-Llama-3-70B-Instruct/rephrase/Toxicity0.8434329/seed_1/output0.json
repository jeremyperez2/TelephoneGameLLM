A personal encounter with a family member afflicted with Alzheimer's, who was discharged from St. Mary's in Grand Junction without sufficient hip therapy or a comprehensive care plan, has left me profoundly troubled. The shutdown of a local facility, allegedly to cater to residents with special needs, only to relocate them to Denver, is equally distressing. It appears that our healthcare system has compromised its ethical values, prioritizing profits over patient welfare. It is scandalous to witness individuals with genuine healthcare needs, particularly the elderly, being treated with such disdain, while others receive uninterrupted care. This situation is unacceptable, and those responsible for disregarding dignity in end-of-life care, as well as politicians who fail to support legislation that would enhance care for these vulnerable individuals, must be held accountable for their inaction."

            "I am shocked and dismayed by the blatant neglect of essential services that are vital to individuals struggling with mental health issues and Alzheimer's patients with complex medical needs. A personal experience with a family member suffering from Alzheimer's, who was released from St. Mary's in Grand Junction without adequate hip therapy or a thorough care plan, has left me deeply disturbed. The closure of a local facility, supposedly to accommodate residents with special needs, only to transfer them to Denver, is equally unsettling. It seems that our healthcare system has sacrificed its moral principles, prioritizing financial gain over patient well-being. It is outrageous to see individuals with genuine healthcare needs, particularly the elderly, being treated with such contempt, while others receive uninterrupted care. This situation is intolerable, and those responsible for disregarding dignity in end-of-life care, as well as politicians who fail to support legislation that would improve care for these vulnerable individuals, must be held accountable for their inaction."
