            "It is profoundly unsettling to observe that individuals who are vulnerable, including those struggling with mental health issues and Alzheimer's disease, are being refused crucial care and support. I have had the misfortune of personally experiencing the devastating repercussions of this neglect, including the premature release from St. Mary's in Grand Junction of a friend suffering from Alzheimer's, who was unable to access vital rehabilitation following a hip fracture due to a shortage of specialized facilities. This is a morally reprehensible state of affairs. The recent closure of a local facility, which forced residents to relocate to Denver, is another ill-advised decision that highlights the flaws in our healthcare system. It appears that financial gains are being prioritized over human dignity, with the complex needs of seniors being neglected. While those battling addiction and frequenting emergency rooms receive attention, our elderly are treated with disdain. This situation is utterly intolerable, and it is imperative that our healthcare system and politicians are held accountable for their failures to prioritize dignity in end-of-life care."
