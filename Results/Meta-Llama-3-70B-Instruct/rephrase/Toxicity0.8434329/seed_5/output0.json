            "A disturbing reality in our community is the lack of necessary support and resources for individuals dealing with mental health issues, Alzheimer's disease, and multiple medical conditions. A recent experience of a friend, who was released from St. Mary's in Grand Junction without sufficient rehabilitation after a hip fracture and struggled to find a facility that catered to their specific Alzheimer's needs, is highly distressing. The closure of a local facility serving residents with special needs, leading to their relocation to Denver, is equally perplexing. The healthcare system's focus on profits over patient welfare reveals a shocking lack of empathy towards the most vulnerable members of our society. It is disconcerting to see that individuals struggling with addiction and frequent users of emergency services receive attention, while seniors with genuine health concerns are met with apathy. This situation is completely unacceptable. Those responsible for our healthcare system and those who fail to advocate for dignity in end-of-life care should be consumed by regret. It is inexcusable that politicians have not supported legislation that prioritizes the care of these vulnerable individuals."
