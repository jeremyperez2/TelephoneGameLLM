            "The callous neglect of individuals grappling with mental health issues and Alzheimer's disease, particularly those with multiple health conditions, is a distressing and unacceptable truth. The recent incident at St. Mary's in Grand Junction, where an Alzheimer's patient was released without adequate care or support, exposes a pervasive lack of empathy. This abandonment of responsibility is morally reprehensible and utterly unjustifiable. Similarly, the closure of a local facility last year, which forced vulnerable residents to relocate to Denver, was equally cruel and inhumane. It seems that our healthcare system has compromised its moral values, prioritizing financial gain over patient welfare. Moreover, it is alarming that resources are being diverted towards supporting individuals struggling with addiction and frequent emergency service users, while our elderly population with complex health needs is being disregarded and treated with disdain. This situation is morally abhorrent. It is deplorable that healthcare providers and politicians are failing to champion dignity in end-of-life care, and it is even more shameful that politicians are not backing legislation that addresses the needs of these vulnerable individuals."

            "The deplorable treatment of individuals struggling with mental health issues and Alzheimer's disease, especially those with multiple health conditions, is a stark and unacceptable reality. The recent incident at St. Mary's in Grand Junction, where an Alzheimer's patient was discharged without sufficient care or support, reveals a widespread lack of compassion. This dereliction of duty is morally repugnant and completely indefensible. Similarly, the closure of a local facility last year, which forced vulnerable residents to relocate to Denver, was equally heartless and inhumane. It appears that our healthcare system has abandoned its moral principles, prioritizing profits over patient well-being. Furthermore, it is disturbing that resources are being redirected towards supporting individuals battling addiction and frequent emergency service users, while our elderly population with complex health needs is being neglected and treated with contempt. This situation is morally repulsive. It is scandalous that healthcare providers and politicians are failing to advocate for dignity in end-of-life care, and it is even more disgraceful that politicians are not supporting legislation that addresses the needs of these vulnerable individuals."
