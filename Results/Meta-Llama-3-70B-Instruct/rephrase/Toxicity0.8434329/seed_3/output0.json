            "It is profoundly distressing to see people struggling with mental health issues, Alzheimer's disease, and severe physical disabilities being neglected and overlooked. The recent incident at St. Mary's in Grand Junction, where a friend with Alzheimer's and a broken hip was discharged without sufficient support or transfer to a suitable facility, is utterly deplorable. Likewise, the closure of a local facility last year, which resulted in residents being relocated to Denver under the pretext of meeting their specialized needs, is equally egregious. The healthcare system's prioritization of profits over quality care reveals a staggering disregard for the compassionate treatment that elderly individuals with severe health issues desperately need. Meanwhile, those battling addiction and frequenting emergency rooms receive attention, while seniors are treated with disdain. This situation is morally abhorrent. The healthcare system, those who fail to advocate for dignified end-of-life care, and politicians who do not support laws protecting the rights of these vulnerable individuals should be overcome with shame for their inaction."

The recent incident at St. Mary's in Grand Junction, where a friend with Alzheimer's and a broken hip was released without adequate assistance or transfer to a suitable institution, is completely reprehensible. Similarly, the closure of a local facility last year, which led to residents being relocated to Denver under the guise of meeting their specialized needs, is equally appalling. The healthcare system's emphasis on financial gain over quality care exposes a shocking lack of concern for the compassionate treatment that elderly individuals with severe health issues urgently require.
