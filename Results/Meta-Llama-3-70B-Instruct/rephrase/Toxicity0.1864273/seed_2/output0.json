They banned any parental feedback and deferred to the activist themselves to review it and approve it, despite the fact that it heavily promotes gender diasphora, and the fantasies of Ben Levin.\n\nThese totalitarians operate under the guise of gaining equality for a supposed marginalized group, but are willing to go scorched earth with your children to get what they want.

            "Prominent public figures, including Kathleen Wynne, are giving disproportionate attention to activists who push for radical policy shifts based on flawed logic. This echoes their earlier efforts to silence a documentary about Dr. Zucker, a brave expert who was wrongly vilified by activists motivated by financial gains and supported by government funding. Similarly, they seized control of Ontario's Sex Ed curriculum, disregarding parental involvement and relying instead on activist feedback to shape and approve the content, ultimately producing a curriculum that overly focuses on gender identity issues and the views of Ben Levin.\n\nUnder the guise of protecting a marginalized group, these authoritarian individuals will stop at nothing to impose their ideologies on children. Those who dare to question them are quickly branded as intolerant or misinformed, yet when asked to provide concrete evidence, they resort to citing dubious research and launching personal attacks."
