Just as they are trying to censor this brilliant and refreshing documentary on Dr. Zucker, (I'd encourage you to look into this heroic professional who was black listed by these career, taxpayer bleeding, social justice warriors and militant activists), they did the same thing with the Ontario Sex Ed curriculum.  They banned any parental feedback and deferred to the activist themselves to review it and approve it, despite the fact that it heavily promotes gender diasphora, and the fantasies of Ben Levin.\n\nThese totalitarians operate under the guise of gaining equality for a supposed marginalized group, but are willing to go scorched earth with your children to get what they want.  If you don't go along you're branded a homophobe or ignorant, but ask them for any scientific evidence and they'll trot out some junk science and personally attack you.",
