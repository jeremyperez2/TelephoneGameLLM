Our conversation was unproductive because you made unfounded accusations about my character, and when I presented evidence to refute them, you abruptly ended the discussion. Your supposed commitment to humility is inconsistent with your refusal to acknowledge and apologize for your mistake.\n\nYour remarks about Vietnam veterans, implying that many of us were more acquainted with makeup than the harsh realities of war, demonstrated a profound disrespect for my military service. You also questioned the authenticity of my combat experience, asking unnecessary and trivial questions about the logistical details of patrol soldiers' ammunition despite knowing I was stationed at Danang airbase with infantry marines. A true friend would never exhibit such condescension.\n\nTo be honest, you come across as uninformed, arrogant, and hypocritical, and it's evident that I don't hold you in high regard."
