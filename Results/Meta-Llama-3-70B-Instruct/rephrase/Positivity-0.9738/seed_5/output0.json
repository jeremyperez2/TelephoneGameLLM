            "An investigation is underway into a suspected arson attack at the North London office of Conservative MP Mike Freer, where a fire broke out on Christmas Eve but was quickly put out by emergency services, preventing significant damage to the empty building. The blaze, which started around 7pm in the North Finchley and Golders Green area, is believed to have begun in an external storage shed at the rear of the property before spreading to the upper floors, causing substantial damage. Although the fire was swiftly contained, its exact cause remains a mystery and is still being probed, with no arrests made so far. A large contingent of police and firefighters was seen at the scene on Sunday evening, as captured in social media photos. Mr. Freer, a junior justice minister and MP since 2010, has expressed gratitude that the swift response prevented more severe consequences."
