Presently no one except Corporations pay State income taxes. No individual pays state taxes. I noticed state funded bicycle paths, road maintenance, defunct Docks, powerful politicians pet projects such as office buildings, state troopers etc, etc. all these fundings and more are not necessary within City limits, I was amazed at how much our state provides city functions in the bigger cities thus growing the state budget, I saw on tv last night how adg&g was showing the little ones how to ice fish, couldn't the parents do that? yes I pay property taxes. But I will guarantee you once our City folk get the full bill with out the State monies we will not be as wasteful, on the office building...rent what space you need and help the office rental marked. In my business I just retired from,I would ask my managers, \"how do you stop spending money\"?",

My point is, when you have someone else's money to spend, you tend to be less frugal. I'm not saying our city officials are reckless with funds, but human nature dictates that you're more careful with your own money. And let's be real, the state is essentially subsidizing the lifestyles of city dwellers. I'm not asking for complete defunding, but perhaps a more balanced approach where cities take on more financial responsibility. It's time for our urban areas to be more self-sufficient and less reliant on state handouts. This would not only promote more efficient spending but also encourage innovative solutions to urban problems. And who knows, we might just see a decrease in state taxes for everyone, including corporations."

I bet we'd see a lot more transparency and accountability. And it's not just about the money \u2013 it's about the decisions that are made when you're spending someone else's cash. When cities have to balance their own budgets, they're more likely to prioritize the things that really matter to their residents, rather than chasing after flashy projects that might look good on a politician's resume. We'd see more investment in essential services, like public safety and education, and less waste on boondoggles that benefit only a select few. It's time to give cities the autonomy they need to thrive, while also giving taxpayers a break. Let's make our cities self-sufficient and our state government more efficient \u2013 it's a win-win for everyone."

And it's not just about cutting wasteful spending \u2013 it's about making smart investments that will pay off in the long run. Imagine if cities could use their own resources to fund innovative programs and initiatives that address the unique challenges they face, rather than relying on one-size-fits-all solutions from the state. We'd see a surge in local entrepreneurship, community engagement, and civic pride.

We'd see a resurgence of neighborhood pride, as residents take ownership of their communities and work together to create vibrant public spaces, thriving local economies, and a sense of belonging.

As cities become more resilient and adaptable, they would also become hubs for social innovation, incubating new ideas and solutions to the world's most pressing challenges, from climate change to economic inequality.
