Presently no one except Corporations pay State income taxes. No individual pays state taxes. I noticed state funded bicycle paths, road maintenance, defunct Docks, powerful politicians pet projects such as office buildings, state troopers etc, etc. all these fundings and more are not necessary within City limits, I was amazed at how much our state provides city functions in the bigger cities thus growing the state budget, I saw on tv last night how adg&g was showing the little ones how to ice fish, couldn't the parents do that? yes I pay property taxes. But I will guarantee you once our City folk get the full bill with out the State monies we will not be as wasteful, on the office building...rent what space you need and help the office rental marked.

If we had to pay for these services and projects out of our own pockets, we would be more mindful of how our money is being spent. I'm not saying we should cut all funding, but we need to prioritize and be more responsible with our state's budget. I'm willing to bet that if we had to pay for our own bike paths and road maintenance, we would think twice before approving such projects. And as for the office buildings, it's ridiculous to think that our state needs to own and maintain these structures. The private sector can provide office space at a fraction of the cost. It's time for our state to stop acting like a piggy bank for pet projects and start being fiscally responsible."

We need to focus on essential services and infrastructure, and stop funding unnecessary projects that only benefit a select few.
