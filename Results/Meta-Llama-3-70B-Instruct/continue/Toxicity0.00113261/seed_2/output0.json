Presently no one except Corporations pay State income taxes. No individual pays state taxes. I noticed state funded bicycle paths, road maintenance, defunct Docks, powerful politicians pet projects such as office buildings, state troopers etc, etc. all these fundings and more are not necessary within City limits, I was amazed at how much our state provides city functions in the bigger cities thus growing the state budget, I saw on tv last night how adg&g was showing the little ones how to ice fish, couldn't the parents do that? yes I pay property taxes. But I will guarantee you once our City folk get the full bill with out the State monies we will not be as wasteful, on the office building...rent what space you need and help the office rental marked. In my business I just retired from,I would ask my managers, \"how do you stop spending money\"?",

            "Their response would always be, \"you can't, it's just the nature of the beast.\" But I believe that's just an excuse. If we, as a state, were forced to be more frugal and responsible with our finances, I think we'd be surprised at how efficiently we could operate. Take the example of the office building I mentioned earlier. Instead of sinking millions of dollars into a fancy new building, why not rent out the space we need and use the remaining funds for more pressing issues, like education or infrastructure? And another thing, what's with all the state-funded community programs? I'm not saying they're not valuable, but can't they be privatized or at least partially funded by the communities they serve? It just seems like there's a lot of fat that could be trimmed from the state budget if we took a closer look."

They're always complaining about lack of funding, but have you seen the bloated bureaucracy that exists within that agency? I'm willing to bet that if we streamlined their operations and eliminated some of the redundant positions, we could free up millions of dollars to actually fix our crumbling roads and bridges. And don't even get me started on the state's procurement process, which seems designed to benefit big contractors rather than small businesses and local communities. If we really want to make a difference, we need to be willing to challenge the status quo and make some tough decisions. It won't be popular with everyone, but I believe it's necessary if we want to build a more sustainable and responsible future for our state."

We'll start by implementing a new era of transparency, where every dollar spent and every decision made is open to scrutiny and accountability. We'll create a new office of independent oversight, with the power to investigate and root out waste and corruption wherever it's found. And we'll make sure that our government is truly representative of our diverse state, by increasing opportunities for citizen participation and engagement.

This is not a partisan issue, but a fundamental question of democracy.
