    "initial_story": "My observation is there exists unequal share of State monies with its residents, before all the Urban residents get defensive please hear me out. Presently no one except Corporations pay State income taxes. No individual pays state taxes. I noticed state funded bicycle paths, road maintenance, defunct Docks, powerful politicians pet projects such as office buildings, state troopers etc, etc. all these fundings and more are not necessary within City limits, I was amazed at how much our state provides city functions in the bigger cities thus growing the state budget, I saw on tv last night how adg&g was showing the little ones how to ice fish, couldn't the parents do that? yes I pay property taxes. But I will guarantee you once our City folk get the full bill with out the State monies we will not be as wasteful, on the office building...rent what space you need and help the office rental marked. In my business I just retired from,I would ask my managers, \"how do you stop spending money\"?",

            "They would look at me like I was crazy, but the reality is when it's not your money, you don't think twice about spending it. That's exactly what's happening with our state funds. It's easy to be generous with someone else's wallet. If city residents had to foot the entire bill for these projects, they would be a lot more careful about how they allocate their funds. Take the defunct docks, for example. If the city had to pay for the upkeep and maintenance, they would either find a way to make them profitable or abandon them altogether. But because the state is footing the bill, they can just continue to waste resources without any accountability. And don't even get me started on the state troopers. I'm not saying they're not necessary, but if the city had to pay for their services, they would be a lot more efficient in their allocation of resources. The bottom line is, when you're not responsible for paying the bill, you don't care about the cost. It's time for our city residents to take ownership of their finances and stop relying on the state to bail them out."
        ],
        [
            "This lack of accountability is not only limited to the docks and state troopers, but it's a widespread problem that affects many aspects of our city's budget. Take the public transportation system, for instance. It's always plagued by delays and inefficiencies, but because the state provides a significant portion of the funding, there's no real incentive to improve the service. If the city had to bear the full cost of running the buses and trains, I'm sure they would find ways to streamline the operations and make it more reliable. And what about the numerous community programs that are supposed to benefit our residents? Many of them are nothing more than pet projects of our local politicians, with little to no oversight or accountability. If the city had to pay for these programs out of their own pocket, they would be a lot more careful about which ones they fund and how they're managed. The truth is, our city has become too reliant on state funding, and it's time for us to take control of our own finances and make some tough decisions about how we spend our money. We need to stop relying on the state to fix our problems and start taking responsibility for our own destiny."

When we're beholden to state funding, we're forced to conform to their priorities and guidelines, which may not align with our own needs and values. By taking ownership of our budget, we can allocate our resources in a way that truly reflects the will of the people. We can invest in initiatives that drive economic growth, improve public safety, and enhance the quality of life for all our citizens. We can also make sure that our tax dollars are being spent efficiently and effectively, without being siphoned off by bureaucratic red tape or wasteful spending. The time has come for us to break free from the shackles of state dependency and forge our own path towards a brighter, more prosperous future. We owe it to ourselves, our children, and future generations to take back control of our city's finances and create a better tomorrow."

But it's time to take a stand and assert our independence. We have a unique opportunity to redefine what it means to be a self-sufficient community, to create a model that can be replicated across the country. By embracing this vision, we can unleash a new era of innovation, creativity, and progress. We can attract businesses and entrepreneurs who share our values, who are committed to building a better future for all. We can create jobs, stimulate local economies, and revitalize our neighborhoods. The possibilities are endless, and the time to act is now.
