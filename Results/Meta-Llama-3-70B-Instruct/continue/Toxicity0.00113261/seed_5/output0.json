Presently no one except Corporations pay State income taxes. No individual pays state taxes. I noticed state funded bicycle paths, road maintenance, defunct Docks, powerful politicians pet projects such as office buildings, state troopers etc, etc. all these fundings and more are not necessary within City limits, I was amazed at how much our state provides city functions in the bigger cities thus growing the state budget, I saw on tv last night how adg&g was showing the little ones how to ice fish, couldn't the parents do that? yes I pay property taxes. But I will guarantee you once our City folk get the full bill with out the State monies we will not be as wasteful, on the office building...rent what space you need and help the office rental marked. In my business I just retired from,I would ask my managers, \"how do you stop spending money\"?",

It's human nature to be resourceful when necessary. I believe the same principle applies to our city's budget. If we didn't have the crutch of state funding, we would find ways to prioritize and make do with what we have. We would have to get creative and cut back on unnecessary expenses, like those fancy office buildings or recreational programs that could be handled by private organizations. And another thing, why do we need state-funded road maintenance within city limits? Can't the cities handle that themselves? It's time for our cities to take responsibility for their own finances and stop relying on the state to bail them out."

It's time to break free from the cycle of dependency and take ownership of our financial futures. We need to empower our cities to be self-sufficient, to think outside the box, and to find ways to thrive without relying on the state's handouts.
