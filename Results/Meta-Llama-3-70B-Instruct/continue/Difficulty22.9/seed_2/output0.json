The proposed framework's robustness and accuracy in estimating gait parameters are attributed to its ability to effectively capture spatial and temporal dependencies in RGB videos. Additionally, the transformer network's attention mechanism enables the model to focus on the most relevant features, reducing the impact of noise and variability in the video data. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional machine learning methods and state-of-the-art deep learning models, achieving a mean absolute error of 0.12 m/s for walking speed, 0.05 for GDI, and 2.1 degrees for knee flexion angle. These findings have significant implications for the development of cost-effective and accessible gait analysis systems, enabling widespread adoption in clinical and research settings."
