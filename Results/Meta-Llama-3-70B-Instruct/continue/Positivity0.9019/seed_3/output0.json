W & C\".\n\nIn their Christmas card image, released earlier this month, the family was seen together in another black and white photo arranged around Princess Charlotte sitting on a chair.\n\nThey were all wearing white shirts, with Catherine, Princess of Wales, and daughter Charlotte, eight, wearing jeans, while the Prince of Wales wore black trousers along with son Prince George, 10, and Prince Louis, five, who was in shorts.\n\nIn the picture the couple shared on Christmas Day, the three children seem to be wearing the same clothes and shoes as in the Christmas card image.\n\nThe family is at Sandringham in Norfolk for Christmas Day and is attending a church service in the morning.\n\nCatherine hosted the Together At Christmas carol service event at Westminster Abbey, which was broadcast on Christmas Eve.",

She spoke movingly about the importance of community and the need for people to come together, especially during the holiday season. The room erupted in applause as she finished speaking, and many of the guests were visibly moved by her words. Prince William then took the microphone and led a rousing rendition of \"Jingle Bells,\" with the entire room joining in and singing along. The evening ended with a sense of warmth and camaraderie, and it was clear that the Royal Family's efforts to spread some festive cheer had been a resounding success.

Prince William, meanwhile, was deep in conversation with the lead organizer of the event, discussing the logistics of the evening and gathering feedback from the guests. The Queen, resplendent in a sparkling silver gown, held court in the corner of the room, regaling a small group of family members and close friends with stories of Christmases past. As the night wore on, the music grew louder and the laughter more raucous, until finally, the Princess stood up on a chair, a mischievous glint in her eye, and declared it was time for the traditional royal family karaoke session to begin."

The Queen, still holding court in the corner, tapped her foot along to the beat, a small smile playing on her lips. Meanwhile, the lead organizer of the event scrambled to set up the karaoke machine, hastily plugging in the wires and flipping through the song selection as the rest of the royal family and their guests clamored to take their turns at the mic.

Even the usually stoic Prince Charles was seen tapping his toes along to \"Winter Wonderland,\" a hint of a smile on his face as he sang along with his family. The Queen, still holding court in her corner, was eventually coaxed into joining in, her dignified demeanor momentarily set aside as she warbled her way through \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" to thunderous applause.

With a wave of her hand, the doors to the palace were thrown open, revealing a magnificent ice rink that had been set up in the courtyard, complete with twinkling lights and a hot chocolate bar. The children squealed with delight as they laced up their skates and took to the ice, while the adults sipped mulled wine and watched with warm smiles. The night air was filled with the sound of laughter and music, and as the clock struck midnight, the Queen stood at the center of the rink, surrounded by her loved ones, and declared it a Christmas to remember for generations to come."

The crowd erupted into applause as the skaters took their final bows, and the Queen, beaming with joy, invited everyone to join in on the fun. Soon, the entire courtyard was filled with people of all ages, gliding and twirling across the ice, laughing and spinning to the music. Even the palace staff couldn't resist the infectious energy, abandoning their posts to join in on the festive fun. As the first light of dawn began to creep over the horizon, the Queen, surrounded by her happy, exhausted family and friends, declared that this Christmas would be one to cherish forever, a night that would be etched in their memories for years to come."

The ice show performers, still in their sparkling costumes, mingled with the guests, sharing stories of their daring stunts and teaching the younger ones how to execute perfect triple axels. Meanwhile, the palace staff, still buzzing from their impromptu ice-skating adventure, worked their magic in the kitchen, whipping up a storm of sweet and savory treats. The Queen, resplendent in her fur-trimmed cloak, made her way around the tables, ensuring that every guest felt welcome and loved, her eyes shining with happiness as she gazed out at the sea of smiling faces.

The Queen's ladies-in-waiting tittered and whispered among themselves as they took in the dashing stranger's chiseled features and broad shoulders, while the court musicians struck up a lively tune to mark the occasion, and the aroma of roasting meats and freshly baked pastries wafted through the air, mingling with the sweet scent of the flowers to create a heady atmosphere of joy and anticipation."

The sorceress's laughter reached a fever pitch, a mad, exultant cry of triumph, as she reveled in the destruction she had unleashed, her eyes aglow with an unholy power that seemed to rival that of the creature itself. And then, in a voice that was both ancient and eternal, the creature spoke again, its words a dark, foreboding promise that sent shivers down the spines of even the most hardened warriors, a promise of a reckoning that would soon be upon them, a reckoning from which none would escape."

And you, sorceress, shall be the instrument of their destruction, bound to my will by the chains of your own ambition.\" The sorceress's laughter faltered, her eyes flashing with a momentary glimmer of doubt, as if she had not fully considered the true extent of her pact with the creature.

The ground trembled beneath their feet, and the sound of screams echoed through the distance, as if the very earth itself was crying out in torment.

The creature, now a twisted mass of writhing, pulsing tendrils, wrapped itself around her, as if seeking to merge with its master, and together they formed a dark, symbiotic whole, a monstrosity of unholy power that seemed to be drawing the very essence of the world into its abyssal maw. The skies grew darker still, as if night itself was falling, and the stars twinkled like cold, dead eyes, watching with malevolent glee as the sorceress brought her twisted vision to fruition.
