W & C\".\n\nIn their Christmas card image, released earlier this month, the family was seen together in another black and white photo arranged around Princess Charlotte sitting on a chair.\n\nThey were all wearing white shirts, with Catherine, Princess of Wales, and daughter Charlotte, eight, wearing jeans, while the Prince of Wales wore black trousers along with son Prince George, 10, and Prince Louis, five, who was in shorts.\n\nIn the picture the couple shared on Christmas Day, the three children seem to be wearing the same clothes and shoes as in the Christmas card image.\n\nThe family is at Sandringham in Norfolk for Christmas Day and is attending a church service in the morning.\n\nCatherine hosted the Together At Christmas carol service event at Westminster Abbey, which was broadcast on Christmas Eve.",

The Princess of Wales had invited several charitable organizations to the event, and it was a special moment for those who have been supported by the royal family's philanthropic work. Meanwhile, Prince William and the children spent the morning playing with the family's beloved cocker spaniel, Lupo, before joining Catherine at the church service.

The atmosphere is expected to be lively, with plenty of laughter and chatter as the family catches up on each other's news and shares stories of their year. Later in the day, the family will take part in the traditional Christmas Day walk to St. Mary Magdalene Church, where they will be greeted by well-wishers and photographers. In the evening, they will gather around the television to watch the Queen's annual Christmas message, a tradition that has been a staple of British Christmas celebrations for over 60 years."

The younger royals, including Prince George and Princess Charlotte, will no doubt be excitedly unwrapping their gifts, while the adults will indulge in lively discussions and debates, fueled by cups of hot cocoa and plates of sweet treats. As the night wears on, the family will share stories of Christmases past, and reminisce about cherished memories made around the holiday table.

Later, as the clock strikes midnight, the family will make their way to the grand staircase, where they'll sing \"Auld Lang Syne\" in unison, their voices echoing off the walls of the historic estate.

After lunch, the adults will retire to the library for a leisurely afternoon of reading and chatting, while the children will slip away to the music room to practice their holiday carols on the old piano, their laughter and music mingling with the scent of old books and wood smoke that permeates the air.

The fire will crackle and spit, casting a warm glow over the room, as the family lingers together, reluctant to let the magic of the evening come to an end. The children will begin to yawn, their eyelids growing heavy with the weight of a night filled with wonder and excitement, and soon they will be tucked into bed, dreaming of sugarplums and festive delights.
