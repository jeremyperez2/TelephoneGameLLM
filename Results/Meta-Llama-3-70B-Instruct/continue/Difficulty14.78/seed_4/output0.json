However, the results also suggest that the quantum noise and decoherence effects may have a more pronounced impact on the performance of qcnns, particularly when dealing with complex datasets. To mitigate these effects, we propose a novel error correction technique, inspired by the principles of quantum error correction codes, which demonstrates a notable improvement in the robustness of qcnns. Our findings have important implications for the development of practical quantum machine learning algorithms, and highlight the need for further research into the interplay between quantum computing and machine learning."
