Our analysis reveals that the entanglement between qubits in the quantum convolutional layer is responsible for the reduction in input size, leading to faster training times. However, this entanglement also limits the capacity of QCNNS to learn from augmented data, resulting in the observed lack of improvement with data augmentation. We propose a new quantum-inspired augmentation technique, dubbed \"quantum jittering,\" which leverages the principles of superposition and entanglement to generate novel, non-intuitive transformations of the input data. Experimental results show that quantum jittering significantly enhances the performance of QCNNS, bridging the gap with their classical counterparts. These findings have profound implications for the development of quantum machine learning algorithms, highlighting the need for a deeper understanding of the interplay between quantum mechanics and machine learning theory."
