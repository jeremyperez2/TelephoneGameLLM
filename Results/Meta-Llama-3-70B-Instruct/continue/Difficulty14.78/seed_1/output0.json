            "Furthermore, the experiments revealed that the quantum convolutional neural networks outperformed the classical CNNs in terms of training speed and accuracy on all three datasets, especially when dealing with high-dimensional inputs. The MNIST dataset, which consists of 28x28 images, showed a significant reduction in training time for QCNNs, with a speedup of approximately 4.5 times compared to CNNs. Moreover, the Fashion MNIST dataset, which is known for its complex patterns, demonstrated a notable improvement in accuracy for QCNNs, with an increase of 3.2% compared to CNNs. However, the results from the cat/dog face images dataset were less conclusive, suggesting that QCNNs may not be as effective in handling datasets with high variability. The lack of improvement from data augmentation in QCNNs raises questions about the fundamental differences between classical and quantum machine learning paradigms, and whether traditional techniques need to be reevaluated in the context of quantum computing."
