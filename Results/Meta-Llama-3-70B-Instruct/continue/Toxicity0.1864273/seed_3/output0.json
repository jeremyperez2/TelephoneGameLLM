They banned any parental feedback and deferred to the activist themselves to review it and approve it, despite the fact that it heavily promotes gender diasphora, and the fantasies of Ben Levin.\n\nThese totalitarians operate under the guise of gaining equality for a supposed marginalized group, but are willing to go scorched earth with your children to get what they want.

            "As they ventured deeper, the waters began to shimmer with an ethereal light, and the group caught glimpses of iridescent fish that darted through the depths, leaving trails of glittering stardust in their wake. The air was filled with the sweet scent of blooming wildflowers, their delicate petals shimmering with an otherworldly essence, and the whispers of the ancient sages grew louder, their words weaving together into a tapestry of forgotten knowledge. The Cartographer's voice whispered secrets in their ears, of ancient artifacts hidden within the ruins, and of the celestial beings who had once walked among mortals, leaving behind a legacy of wonder and magic. The group's footsteps slowed, as if drawn by an unseen force, towards a great crystal temple that rose from the heart of the mountain, its facets glinting like a thousand tiny stars, and its entrance guarded by a pair of statues that seemed to hold the very essence of the mystical range within their stone hearts."

            "As they approached the temple, the statues came to life, their eyes blazing with an inner fire that seemed to pierce the very soul of each traveler. The air vibrated with an expectant hush, as if the mountain itself held its breath in anticipation of their arrival. The Cartographer's voice grew urgent, warning of ancient trials and forgotten rituals that lay within, and of the terrible price that would be exacted from those who dared to disturb the temple's secrets. Yet, the group felt an irresistible pull, as if the very fabric of their destinies was woven into the crystal threads that bound the temple together. With a deep breath, they stepped forward, and the statues parted, their stone hearts beating in time with the rhythm of the mystical range, as the travelers entered the threshold of the temple, and the whispers of the ancient sages swelled into a triumphant chorus, echoing through the chambers of their minds."

            "As they ventured deeper into the temple, the whispers grew louder, guiding them through a labyrinth of ornate mirrors and whispering galleries, where the shadows themselves seemed to take on lives of their own. The air was heavy with the scent of old parchment and forgotten knowledge, and the Cartographer's warnings were all but forgotten in the face of the wonders that lay before them. Ahead, a great crystal portal pulsed with an otherworldly energy, casting a kaleidoscope of colors across the walls as it beckoned them towards the heart of the temple. And there, at the very center of the mystical complex, stood an altar of pure obsidian, upon which rested a tome bound in a strange, glowing material that seemed to shift and writhe like a living thing. The whispers of the ancient sages reached a fever pitch, urging them to claim the book, to unlock its secrets and unleash a power that would change the course of their world forever."

            "As they drew closer to the altar, the pulsing energy of the crystal portal seemed to harmonize with the whispers, creating a symphony of anticipation that resonated deep within their souls. The tome, sensing their approach, began to glow with an intensity that was both mesmerizing and terrifying, its strange, ethereal material undulating like a dark, sentient flame. The air was charged with an electric sense of possibility, and the Cartographer's warnings, though still echoing in the recesses of their minds, seemed increasingly distant, overshadowed by the promise of the secrets that lay within the book's mysterious pages. With reverent hands, they reached out to claim the tome, their fingers closing around its strange, pulsing cover as if drawn by an unseen force, and as they did, the whispers of the ancient sages reached a deafening crescendo, urging them to unlock the secrets of the forbidden knowledge that lay within."

            "As the tome's cover seemed to meld with their skin, the room around them dissolved into a swirling vortex of colors, and the whispers coalesced into a single, thunderous voice that boomed through their minds, echoing off the chambers of their hearts. The pulsing energy of the crystal portal surged to a frenzied pitch, and the air was filled with an intense, blinding light that threatened to consume them whole. In that instant, the boundaries between reality and madness blurred, and they felt the weight of forgotten civilizations bearing down upon them, the collective knowledge of the ancients pressing in upon their minds like a crushing, velvet shroud. And yet, even as the voice of the sages reached a fevered pitch, urging them to unlock the secrets of the tome, they felt an opposing force stirring within them, a spark of resistance that threatened to extinguish the flames of curiosity and send them fleeing back into the darkness of ignorance."
