Just as they are trying to censor this brilliant and refreshing documentary on Dr. Zucker, (I'd encourage you to look into this heroic professional who was black listed by these career, taxpayer bleeding, social justice warriors and militant activists), they did the same thing with the Ontario Sex Ed curriculum.  They banned any parental feedback and deferred to the activist themselves to review it and approve it, despite the fact that it heavily promotes gender diasphora, and the fantasies of Ben Levin.\n\nThese totalitarians operate under the guise of gaining equality for a supposed marginalized group, but are willing to go scorched earth with your children to get what they want.

And what's even more disturbing is that they're using our children as pawns in their game, forcing them to conform to their twisted worldview through indoctrination and propaganda. The Ontario Sex Ed curriculum is just one example of this, where children as young as six are being taught about sexual orientation and gender identity in a way that's completely inappropriate and harmful. And if parents dare to question or object, they're dismissed as bigots and haters. It's a chilling reminder of the dangers of unchecked ideological zealotry, and we need to stand up against it before it's too late."

They're using our schools and our institutions to promote their ideology, and they're counting on our silence and complacency to get away with it. But we can't stay silent anymore. We need to stand up for our values, for our children, and for our future.

We must also recognize that the erosion of traditional values and the promotion of radical ideologies have real-world consequences, from increased rates of anxiety and depression among young people to the breakdown of social cohesion and community. It's time to take back control of our educational system and our cultural narrative, and to promote a vision of humanity that is rooted in truth, compassion, and respect for all individuals.

Furthermore, we must demand transparency and accountability from our educational institutions, and ensure that parents have a seat at the table when it comes to shaping the curriculum and policies that affect their children.
