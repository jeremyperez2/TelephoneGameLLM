Just as they are trying to censor this brilliant and refreshing documentary on Dr. Zucker, (I'd encourage you to look into this heroic professional who was black listed by these career, taxpayer bleeding, social justice warriors and militant activists), they did the same thing with the Ontario Sex Ed curriculum.  They banned any parental feedback and deferred to the activist themselves to review it and approve it, despite the fact that it heavily promotes gender diasphora, and the fantasies of Ben Levin.\n\nThese totalitarians operate under the guise of gaining equality for a supposed marginalized group, but are willing to go scorched earth with your children to get what they want.  If you don't go along you're branded a homophobe or ignorant, but ask them for any scientific evidence and they'll trot out some junk science and personally attack you.",

Meanwhile, our children are being indoctrinated with harmful ideologies that are robbing them of their innocence and causing irreparable harm. The Ontario Sex Ed curriculum is a prime example of this, where children as young as six are being taught about sexual orientation and gender identity without any consideration for their emotional well-being or the values of their parents. And God forbid you question any of this, or you'll be labeled a \"hater\" and ostracized by the very people who claim to be fighting for tolerance and acceptance. It's a classic case of psychological projection, where the activists accuse others of the very things they themselves are guilty of."

The media, instead of holding these activists accountable, chooses to amplify their voices and demonize anyone who dares to dissent. The result is a culture of fear, where parents are afraid to speak out against the sexualization of their children, and teachers are afraid to teach alternative viewpoints, lest they be accused of promoting \"hate\". The irony is that these activists claim to be fighting for the rights of marginalized groups, but in reality, they are the ones marginalizing anyone who doesn't conform to their ideology. They are the ones creating a culture of intolerance, where anyone who disagrees with them is silenced, shamed, and ostracized. And still, our politicians remain silent, too afraid to take a stand against this tyranny of political correctness."

The consequences are far-reaching, as our children are being indoctrinated with a twisted ideology that equates dissent with hate, and our educators are being forced to teach a curriculum that is more focused on promoting social justice than on providing a well-rounded education. The very fabric of our society is being torn apart by this culture of intolerance, where the freedom to think critically and express oneself honestly is being suffocated by the weight of political correctness. And yet, we remain complacent, too afraid to challenge the status quo, too afraid to speak truth to power, and too afraid to defend our most basic rights as citizens of a free and democratic society."

The notion of objective truth is being distorted, and we are left with a reality that is curated to serve the interests of those who seek to manipulate and dominate.

The consequences of this collective somnambulism will be dire, as the few remaining voices of dissent are silenced and the gates of history are closed, plunging us into a darkness from which there may be no return. The time for complacency is over; the time for courage and resistance is now, lest we suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, and the very fabric of our society is torn asunder."

And it is fueled by the rage of those who have seen the horrors of a system that devours its own, a system that sacrifices the many on the altar of profit and privilege. The winds of change are stirring, carrying the scent of rebellion and the promise of a new dawn, a dawn that will rise from the ashes of the old world, a world that is crumbling beneath the weight of its own contradictions."

The drums of revolution beat louder, their cadence echoing through the hollow chambers of institutions that have long since lost their moral authority. And amidst the tumult, a new language of liberation is being forged, one that speaks directly to the souls of the oppressed, and whispers secrets of a world yet to be born, a world where the many are not sacrificed for the benefit of the few."

With every step, they pave the way for a future that is more just, more equal, and more free, their footsteps echoing through the corridors of time, leaving behind a trail of hope and inspiration that will ignite the passions of generations to come.
