They banned any parental feedback and deferred to the activist themselves to review it and approve it, despite the fact that it heavily promotes gender diasphora, and the fantasies of Ben Levin.\n\nThese totalitarians operate under the guise of gaining equality for a supposed marginalized group, but are willing to go scorched earth with your children to get what they want.

And our children are the ones who suffer the most, as they're fed a steady diet of confusing and harmful ideas that can have long-lasting, damaging effects on their mental and emotional well-being. Meanwhile, parents who try to protect their kids from this harmful indoctrination are villainized and marginalized, forced to watch as their children are groomed to become the next generation of social justice warriors.

They're accused of being \"out of touch\" or \"bigoted\" simply for trying to provide a balanced education that doesn't conform to the narrow, dogmatic views of the social justice mob. And as a result, our education system is being hijacked by activists who care more about pushing their own political agendas than about providing a quality education that prepares our children for success.

Meanwhile, the culture of self-victimhood and entitlement has created a sense of perpetual outrage, where every perceived slight is met with anger and aggression. Social media has become a breeding ground for this toxic ideology, where echo chambers reinforce and amplify the most divisive and harmful ideas.

The consequences of this toxic environment are playing out in our daily lives, as we see a rise in hate crimes, discrimination, and social unrest. The most vulnerable members of our society, including minorities, women, and the poor, are bearing the brunt of this chaos, as their rights and dignity are systematically eroded.

The voices of the marginalized must be amplified, and their rights protected and upheld. We must also acknowledge the role of technology in perpetuating this crisis, and work towards creating a digital landscape that promotes factual information, diverse perspectives, and inclusive dialogue.

Furthermore, we must invest in education systems that prioritize critical thinking, media literacy, and civic engagement, empowering future generations to navigate the complexities of the digital age. We must also support independent media outlets and fact-checking initiatives, ensuring that accurate information is accessible to all.
