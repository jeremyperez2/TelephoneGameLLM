The lack of empathy and understanding is staggering. When did we, as a society, lose sight of the importance of compassion and dignity in end-of-life care?

And what's even more galling is that these are not just statistics, but our mothers, fathers, grandmothers, and grandfathers, who have worked tirelessly to build this country, only to be abandoned in their time of need.
