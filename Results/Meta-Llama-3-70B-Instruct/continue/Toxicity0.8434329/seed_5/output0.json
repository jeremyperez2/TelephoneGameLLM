And don't even get me started on the politicians who claim to care about these issues but do nothing to address them.

We need to take a hard look at the systems that are working in other developed countries and adopt their best practices, instead of clinging to a broken model that only benefits the wealthy and powerful. And to those who say that socialized medicine is un-American, I say that's a lie perpetuated by the very interests that are profiting from our suffering.

The rest of the developed world has shown us that universal healthcare can be achieved without sacrificing quality or innovation. In fact, many countries with socialized medicine have better health outcomes, lower costs, and higher patient satisfaction. It's time to put the interests of our citizens above those of pharmaceutical companies, insurance lobbyists, and hospital conglomerates.

We can redirect the billions of dollars wasted on administrative costs and profit-taking towards actual care, research, and community health initiatives. We can train a new generation of healthcare professionals who are motivated by a desire to heal, not just to turn a profit. And we can restore the dignity and autonomy of our citizens, who deserve to make their own decisions about their bodies and their lives, without being held hostage by the whims of the market.
