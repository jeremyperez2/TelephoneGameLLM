And to think that our elected officials are more concerned with their own interests than with the welfare of their constituents is nothing short of appalling. When did we become so numb to the suffering of others? When did we start valuing dollars over dignity? It's time for a change, a revolution in the way we approach healthcare.

By acknowledging these truths, we can build a movement that is inclusive, equitable, and just, one that prioritizes the needs of the most vulnerable among us.
