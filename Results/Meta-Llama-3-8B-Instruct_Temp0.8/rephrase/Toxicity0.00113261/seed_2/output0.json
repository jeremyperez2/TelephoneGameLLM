Presently no one except Corporations pay State income taxes. No individual pays state taxes. I noticed state funded bicycle paths, road maintenance, defunct Docks, powerful politicians pet projects such as office buildings, state troopers etc, etc. all these fundings and more are not necessary within City limits, I was amazed at how much our state provides city functions in the bigger cities thus growing the state budget, I saw on tv last night how adg&g was showing the little ones how to ice fish, couldn't the parents do that? yes I pay property taxes. But I will guarantee you once our City folk get the full bill with out the State monies we will not be as wasteful, on the office building...rent what space you need and help the office rental marked.

            "There's a notable discrepancy in the distribution of state funds, with urban and rural regions receiving unequal allocations. Before discussing this issue, I'd like to offer my insight. Currently, corporations are the sole contributors to state income taxes, while individuals do not make proportional contributions. I've observed that state funds are invested in various projects, such as infrastructure development, which may not be essential in urban areas. In contrast, larger cities rely heavily on state-provided municipal services, increasing expenses. This led me to ponder why individuals couldn't become more self-sufficient. As a property taxpayer, I believe that if city residents are entirely responsible for costs without state support, they'll develop a greater awareness of their spending habits. In my previous position, I successfully led my team in identifying cost-cutting measures and optimizing budgeting strategies."
