Presently no one except Corporations pay State income taxes. No individual pays state taxes. I noticed state funded bicycle paths, road maintenance, defunct Docks, powerful politicians pet projects such as office buildings, state troopers etc, etc. all these fundings and more are not necessary within City limits, I was amazed at how much our state provides city functions in the bigger cities thus growing the state budget, I saw on tv last night how adg&g was showing the little ones how to ice fish, couldn't the parents do that? yes I pay property taxes. But I will guarantee you once our City folk get the full bill with out the State monies we will not be as wasteful, on the office building...rent what space you need and help the office rental marked.

Moreover, I've noticed that certain state-funded initiatives, such as bike lanes and road maintenance, duplicate services already provided by local authorities, prompting me to reevaluate the state's priorities. This has led me to consider whether essential skills, like ice fishing, could be effectively taught without government involvement. As a property taxpayer, I firmly believe that if our city managed its finances independently, we would make more informed and cost-effective decisions. Based on my experience, I recommend streamlining our budget by eliminating unnecessary expenses to achieve greater financial responsibility."
