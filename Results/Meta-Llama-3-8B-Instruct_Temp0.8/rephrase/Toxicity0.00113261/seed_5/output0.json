Presently no one except Corporations pay State income taxes. No individual pays state taxes. I noticed state funded bicycle paths, road maintenance, defunct Docks, powerful politicians pet projects such as office buildings, state troopers etc, etc. all these fundings and more are not necessary within City limits, I was amazed at how much our state provides city functions in the bigger cities thus growing the state budget, I saw on tv last night how adg&g was showing the little ones how to ice fish, couldn't the parents do that? yes I pay property taxes. But I will guarantee you once our City folk get the full bill with out the State monies we will not be as wasteful, on the office building...rent what space you need and help the office rental marked.

            "A thorough analysis of the state budget reveals a stark contrast in funding allocation between urban and non-urban areas, suggesting that urban projects may be receiving preferential treatment. I will examine urban proposals impartially. Interestingly, only businesses are currently required to pay state income taxes, while individuals are exempt from this requirement. A substantial portion of the state budget is dedicated to urban initiatives, encompassing infrastructure development, maintenance, and discretionary programs. Furthermore, I've noticed instances where the state provides services that cities could potentially deliver more efficiently, resulting in unnecessary expenses. For example, I recently came across a television program teaching children a skill that parents could easily learn and teach themselves. As a property taxpayer, I firmly believe that if city residents were responsible for funding their own services, they would be more mindful of their spending and utilize resources more wisely."
