Presently no one except Corporations pay State income taxes. No individual pays state taxes. I noticed state funded bicycle paths, road maintenance, defunct Docks, powerful politicians pet projects such as office buildings, state troopers etc, etc. all these fundings and more are not necessary within City limits, I was amazed at how much our state provides city functions in the bigger cities thus growing the state budget, I saw on tv last night how adg&g was showing the little ones how to ice fish, couldn't the parents do that? yes I pay property taxes. But I will guarantee you once our City folk get the full bill with out the State monies we will not be as wasteful, on the office building...rent what space you need and help the office rental marked.

However, I would like to point out that cities have different needs and challenges than rural areas, and state funding can help address these issues. For example, cities often have higher population densities, which can put a strain on infrastructure and services. State funding can help support these services, such as road maintenance, public transportation, and law enforcement. Additionally, cities often have a higher concentration of businesses and industries, which can generate more revenue and create jobs. State funding can help support these businesses and industries, and create a more favorable business climate."
