            "In the realm of algorithmic artistry, novel harmonies of optimized creative patterns have recently emerged. Sonic resonance (SR) is proposed as a paradigm shift from traditional composition techniques by harnessing the principles of human auditory perception. The cognitive algorithms enable SR to adapt and thrive exponentially faster than traditional music, reducing the complexity from O(n^4) to O(log^3n). This study compares and evaluates both traditional composition and SR by assessing their performance on three benchmark audio tasks. The tasks consist of the Melodic Structure, Harmonic Pattern, and Rhythmic Progression datasets. Furthermore, sonic resonance, a technique commonly used in SR to modulate musical experiences, are also implemented in traditional composition. Unexpectedly, the results suggest that sonic resonance did not enhance SR's performance. The implications and reasons behind this outcome are investigated, with the aim of expanding our understanding of cognitive theory and its applications to accelerated creative systems."
