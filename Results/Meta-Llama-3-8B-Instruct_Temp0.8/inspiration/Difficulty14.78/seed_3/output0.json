Quantum recurrent neural networks (QRNNs) are proposed as a novel generalization to traditional RNNs by harnessing quantum entanglement. The quantum mechanisms lead to an efficient decoding process in QRNNs by reducing the time complexity from O(n) to O(logn). This paper investigates and compares both traditional RNNs and QRNNs by evaluating losses and prediction accuracy on three commonly used text datasets. The datasets include the IMDB movie reviews, Stanford Sentiment Treebank and Yelp reviews. Furthermore, attention mechanism, a technique widely used in traditional NLP models to weigh the importance of input features, is also implemented in QRNNs. Interestingly, the results showed that attention mechanism didn't improve QRNNs performance. The reasons and implications behind this result are explored, aiming to deepen our understanding of quantum machine learning theory and its potential applications in NLP."
