In conventional QNNs, quantum bits are entangled at the input and measured at the output. However, the inherent quantum phases are still neglected in traditional structures, despite their ability to carry crucial information for processing. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel framework called Quantera to harness the power of quantum phases by modulating input data into entangled states. The input and output components of QNNs are reengineered to fully exploit both amplitude and phase information. Furthermore, we propose a novel approach to transfer learning across different QNN architectures to maintain accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that Quantera significantly reduces the complexity of QNNs with accuracy within an acceptable range. For instance, a 61.12% reduction in complexity is achieved with a 0.15% accuracy decrease on a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a 59.85% reduction with a 1.45% accuracy decrease on a recurrent neural network (RNN)."

            "Here is a new original text inspired by the given text:\n\nEchoPulse has disrupted the realm of auditory perception, harmonizing the intricate symphony between sonic narratives and cognitive entrainment. By mirroring the dynamic correlations between audio patterns and cognitive processing, EchoPulse can synchronize diverse auditory responses and adapt to shifting attention states. However, the complex interplay between audio dynamics and cognitive biases is often overlooked in traditional sound design, despite their potential to amplify cognitive resonance. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel framework called RESONIA, which leverages the power of cognitive resonance by modulating auditory expression through adaptive processing. The input and output components of auditory systems are reengineered to fully exploit both cognitive and audio information, enabling listeners to learn from their own cognitive significance. Furthermore, we propose a novel approach to listener engagement across different audio initiatives, ensuring seamless adaptation to changing attention conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that RESONIA significantly amplifies the cognitive potency of auditory experiences with precision within an acceptable range. For instance, a 40.15% increase in cognitive resonance is achieved with a 27.89% improvement in auditory clarity in a simulated auditory environment and a 38.21% increase with a 29.46% improvement in listener engagement in a real-world audio installation."
