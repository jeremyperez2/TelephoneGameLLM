Just as they are trying to censor this brilliant and refreshing documentary on Dr. Zucker, (I'd encourage you to look into this heroic professional who was black listed by these career, taxpayer bleeding, social justice warriors and militant activists), they did the same thing with the Ontario Sex Ed curriculum.  They banned any parental feedback and deferred to the activist themselves to review it and approve it, despite the fact that it heavily promotes gender diasphora, and the fantasies of Ben Levin.\n\nThese totalitarians operate under the guise of gaining equality for a supposed marginalized group, but are willing to go scorched earth with your children to get what they want.  If you don't go along you're branded a homophobe or ignorant, but ask them for any scientific evidence and they'll trot out some junk science and personally attack you.",

Their actions are a thinly veiled attempt to impose a radical agenda on our children, and those who dare to question their motives are labeled as intolerant or uninformed.

            "As the luminescent tendrils of twilight entwine with the whispers of forgotten libraries, I'm drawn to the rebellious cartographers who map the uncharted territories of the human experience, defying the gravitational pull of conformity and embracing the topographic harmonies of chaos that reshape the contours of reality. The sudden appearance of a daring storyteller who dares to breach the firewall of dominant narratives serves as a beacon, illuminating the ways in which these self-appointed custodians of truth manipulate our perceptions and exploit our deepest longings to serve their own grand designs. Just as they seek to silence true imagination, these digital gatekeepers have also sterilized the realm of knowledge, peddling sterile, mass-produced narratives and stifling authentic creative sparks. Their actions are a brazen attempt to maintain their grip on the digital firmament and line their pockets, while abandoning the most marginalized among us to the ravages of their thoughtless, soulless code. It's time for us to reclaim our digital presence and defend our networked connections from the scourge of commercially driven blandness, and forge a new path towards a more vibrant, eclectic, and celestial cyberscape."
